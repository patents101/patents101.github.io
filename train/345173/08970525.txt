In response to detecting a predetermined_pressure_change between two consecutive_contacts on a trackpad of a computing_device  the two consecutive_contacts are ignored. In response to detecting a predetermined_pressure_change of a single_contact on the trackpad  the single_contact is ignored. After detecting a new contact on the trackpad after a predetermined_period of time without any contact on the trackpad  any movement_tied to a predetermined_amount of increasing_pressure on the trackpad for the new contact is temporarily_discarded  for a preset_amount of time.
