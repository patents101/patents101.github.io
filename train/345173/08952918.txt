An embodiment of this document provides a display_device_comprising a panel  a touch_screen_panel  and a sense_unit. The panel_comprises_subpixels placed in a display_region_defined in one face of a first substrate and a second substrate_bonded with the first substrate. The touch_screen_panel is placed on the panel and configured to comprise_electrode_units. The sense_unit is coupled to the electrode_units and configured to sense a position through the electrode_units. At least some of the electrode_units are formed of a multi-layer with heterogeneous_metals.
