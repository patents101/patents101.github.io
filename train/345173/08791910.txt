In one embodiment  a method includes receiving two or more output_signals_responsive to two or more capacitive_couplings. Each of the capacitive_couplings has occurred between a pointing_object and one of two or more sensing_areas within a sensing_region  and each of the sensing_areas has a position within the sensing_region. The method includes  if two or more of the output_signals each have an output-signal_level that exceeds a predefined_activation_level  then selecting a particular one of the sensing_areas with output-signal_levels_exceeding the predefined_activation_level as an intended one of the sensing_areas_based on a predefined_ranking_scheme that takes into account the positions of the sensing_areas within the sensing_region.
