A touch_panel is provided. The touch_panel includes an electroactive polymer  EAP  actuator which is deformable when protruded or depressed_locally at a part to which a driving_voltage is applied  and a flexible_touch_sensor which is disposed on the EAP actuator. The flexible_touch_sensor is deformable_locally in correspondence with a deformation of the EAP actuator  and senses an input according to a contact or pressing_operation.
