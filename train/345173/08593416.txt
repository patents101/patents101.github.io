A touch_device includes a touch_panel  a sensing_unit  and an operation_unit is provided. The sensing_unit is coupled to the touch_panel  for scanning a scan_area of the touch_panel to output a touch_signal. The operation_unit is coupled to the sensing_unit  for determining the scan_area according to the touch_signal. When the touch_signal_corresponds to a first close_path  the operation_unit_defines a close_area_formed by the first close_path as the first sub touch_area. When the first sub touch_area is undefined  the operation_unit_chooses a whole touch_area of the touch_panel as the scan_area. When the first sub touch_area is defined  the operation_chooses the first sub touch_area as the scan_area.
