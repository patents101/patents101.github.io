A signal_processing_method is employed to operate a touch_panel having a first touch_sensing_unit and plural second touch_sensing_units_adjacent to the first touch_sensing_unit. In the operation of the method  a first signal is generated through amplifying the first sensing_signal of the first touch_sensing_unit by N times with N equal to the number of the second touch_sensing_units  a second signal is generated through summing up the second sensing_signals of the second touch_sensing_unit  a difference_signal is generated through subtracting the second signal from the first signal  a comparison_result is generated through comparing the difference_signal with a difference_threshold  and finally the comparison_result is utilized for judging whether a touch_event is occurring to the first touch_sensing_unit.
