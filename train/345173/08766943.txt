Provided are a display having a touch_sensor and a method for improving the touch_performance_thereof  which can minimize the distortion of an execution_result_induced by the process of converting the resolution of touch_coordinates  by compensating the coordinate_values of a touch_position by applying different offset_values for upper__lower__left  and right sides in accordance with the sensor_data_values of surrounding_sensor_nodes_adjacent to a center_node having peak_data.
