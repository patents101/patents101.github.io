Functionality is described herein for detecting and responding to gestures_performed by a user using a computing_device  such as  but not limited to  a tablet_computing_device. In one implementation  the functionality_operates by receiving_touch_input_information in response to the user_touching the computing_device  and movement_input_information in response to the user_moving the computing_device. The functionality then determines whether the input_information indicates that a user has performed or is performing a multi-touch-movement  MTM  gesture. The functionality can then perform any behavior in response to determining that the user has performed an MTM gesture  such as by modifying a view or invoking a function  etc.
