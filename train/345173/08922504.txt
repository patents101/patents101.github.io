Disclosed is a click_gesture_determination_method for a touch_control_chip_capable of simply and flexibly_determining a single_click_gesture. The click_gesture_determination_method includes steps of comparing one or more signal_values of one or more detecting_signals with one or more threshold_values  to determine whether a touch_event_occurs__continuing the above comparing if a touch_event_occurs  to detect a continuous_occurrence_time of the touch_event  and comparing the continuous_occurrence_time with a first predefined_time  and determining that a single_click_gesture_occurs for a result of the comparison that the continuous_occurrence_time is longer than the first predefined_time.
