An in-cell_touch_display_device_comprises a plurality of pixel_structures  a display_scanning_circuit  a touch_scanning_circuit  and a control_module. The pixel_structures are applied to display an image and include a plurality of display_scanning_lines and a plurality of common_electrodes. The display_scanning_circuit is coupled with the display_scanning_lines for actuating the pixel_structures to display the image. The touch_scanning_circuit is coupled with the common_electrodes so as to receive a touch_signal by scanning the common_electrodes. The control_module is coupled with the display_scanning_circuit and the touch_scanning_circuit to receive and process the touch_signal for executing the touch_step. The display_scanning_circuit and the touch_scanning_circuit are integrated on the same substrate to reduce the thickness of the touch_display_device without affecting the touch_effect.
