A display_device includes  a first substrate having a light_extraction_plane  a plurality of first electrodes  an organic_electroluminescence_layer  a second electrode  a second substrate  a sensing_electrode_allowing an object to be detected  and a driving_electrode_forming a capacitance with the sensing_electrode and allowing the object to be detected. The first electrodes  the organic_electroluminescence_layer  the second electrode  and the second substrate are provided in this order on the first substrate. The sensing_electrode and the driving_electrode are provided  in this order from a first substrate_side  between the first substrate and the second substrate.
