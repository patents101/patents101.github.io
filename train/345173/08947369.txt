Digital signal processed touchscreen system. The invention_employs_amplitude_ramped_signals across a touchscreen. The pattern to which the amplitude_ramped_electric_signals are provided may be located on the surface of the touchscreen  or alternatively on the backside of the touchscreen. The signal_processing_employed by the invention  using digital_signal_processing_techniques  is operable to discern a user s touch and to determine its location. A dielectric__protective_surface is used to enable_implementation into a wide_variety of applications__including those applications that are environmentally_rugged and have  until now  been too rugged for prior_art_touchscreen_systems. The invention_employs a user_generated_unbalanced_capacitive_load_generated on the touchscreen to identify the location of the user s touch.
