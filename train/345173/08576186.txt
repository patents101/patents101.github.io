A holding_structure for a touch_panel has a display_panel for configuring a display_screen and a touch_panel for allowing_input_operation. The structure has an elastic_supporting_frame for holding the display_panel at an entire_peripheral_edge and supporting the touch_panel in parallel with the display_panel. The structure has piezoelectric_devices for applying_vibration to the touch_panel in accordance with the operation of the touch_panel. The structure has a casing for holding the display_panel and the touch_panel by way of the elastic_supporting_frame and the casing has an opening through which the touch_panel is exposed. The elastic_supporting_frame_holds the touch_panel at an entire_peripheral_edge of the touch_panel and includes a plurality of touch_panel_supporting_portions for supporting the touch_panel at a side_edge of a rear_surface of the touch_panel.
