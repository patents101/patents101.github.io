A touch_panel includes a plurality of driving_lines  a plurality of sensing_lines and a plurality of sensing_units. The sensing_lines are arranged_intersecting with the driving_lines. The sensing_units are arranged in an array  and each of the sensing_units is electrically_coupled to a corresponding one of the driving_lines and a corresponding one of the sensing_lines. The driving_lines or the sensing_lines only pass through a single_side of the touch_panel.
