A touch_sensor_employing_capacitive_sensing_technology in which a series of conductive_pads_enabling the detection of levels of capacitance_imparted to each of the conductive_pads as a result of the close_proximity of a tip of a digit of a user  in which adjacent_pairs of the conductive_pads_form_slider_controls  in which one of the conductive_pads is a corner-type_conductive_pad at which two adjacent_slider_controls_formed by the corner-type_conductive_pad and each of two adjacent_conductive_pads_forms a corner in the series of slider_controls  and in which the series of slider_controls perhaps forms a rectangular_ring_shape_loop of slider_controls in which there are four of the corner-type_conductive_pads at which four different pairs of slider_controls_meet at right angles.
