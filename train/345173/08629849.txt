A spurious_input_detection_system includes a touch_input_display  a touch_input_surface  and a non-transitory__computer-readable_medium. The non-transitory__computer-readable_medium includes instructions that  when executed by a processor__provide a spurious_input_detection_engine. The spurious_input_detection_engine is operable to receive a first input from the touch_input_display and a second input from the touch_input_surface. The spurious_input_detection_engine is further operable to determine that the first input is a spurious_input_based on a combination of the first input and the second input. The spurious_input_detection_engine will cause the first input to be disregarded in response to determining that it is a spurious_input.
