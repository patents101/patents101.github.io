A liquid_crystal_display_panel includes a touch_sensor and the touch_sensor includes a plurality of x-axis_read-out lines  a plurality of y-axis_read-out lines_crossing the x-axis_read-out lines  a plurality of sensor_units_provided in a plurality of regions_defined by the x-axis_read-out lines and the y-axis_read-out lines. Each sensor_unit_comprises a reset_unit that outputs a sampling_voltage_based on a reset_voltage  a capacitance_detector that generates a modified_sampling_voltage from the sampling_voltage_based on a variation of a cell_gap of the display_panel_caused by a touch of the display_panel  a first output_unit that changes an electric_potential of a corresponding x-axis_read-out line in response to the modified_sampling_voltage and a second output_unit that changes an electric_potential of a corresponding y-axis_read-out line in response to the modified_sampling_voltage.
