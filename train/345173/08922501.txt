A capacitive_sensing_device_comprises first electrodes in which a plurality of first sensing_elements are arranged in rows and columns  and second electrodes in which a plurality of second sensing_elements are arranged in rows and columns. Each of the first sensing_elements has an iron_cross_shape  and each of the second sensing_elements has a double-cross_shape in which a first cross and a second cross_overlap each at a shared_center_point and the second cross is rotated with respect to the first cross. Capacitances are formed between the first sensing_elements and the second sensing_elements.
