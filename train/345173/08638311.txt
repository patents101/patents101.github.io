A display_device and a data_displaying_method_thereof are disclosed. The device includes at least one sensor_including a touch_sensor to generate_touch_events according to touch_events  a flexible_sensor to generate a bend_signal to detect_bend_events  and a pressure_sensor to generate a pressure_signal to detect_pressure_events  a storage_unit to store a function_table  and a controller to control the components of the device. The function_table is configured to define_control_operations to reproduce currently output_contents_based on the touch_events  the bend_events  the pressure_events  and events_combined_thereof.
