Presently described are articles such as antennas  EMI shields  and touch_screen_sensors as well as patterned_substrates having overlaid_micropatterns with low_visibility. Also described are methods of determining the visibility of a patterned_substrate. In one embodiment  a patterned_substrate is described comprising a visible_light_transparent_substrate  and at least two overlaid_electrically_conductive_mesh_micropatterns  wherein each mesh has a repeating_cell_geometry and the combination of overlaid_micropatterns has a spatial_contrast_threshold at a distance of 30000_units of greater than    35_decibels.
