A pointer_detection_apparatus includes a conductor_pattern with first conductors_disposed in a first direction and second conductors_disposed in a second direction that crosses the first direction  and a code_string_signal_production_circuit for producing_signals_based on orthogonal_code_strings with phases different from each other and supplying the produced_signals to the first conductors. The apparatus also includes a signal_detection_circuit_connected to the second conductors for detecting a signal corresponding to a variation of electrostatic_capacitance between the conductor_pattern and a pointer  an analog to digital conversion  ADC  circuit for converting the signal_output from the signal_detection_circuit into a digital_signal_comprising a word_string of multiple_bits  and a correlation_detection_circuit for determining_correlation_values between the code_strings and the word_string. The apparatus also includes a memory for storing_correlation_values_successively_output from the correlation_detection_circuit  wherein the pointer is detected_based on the correlation_values.
