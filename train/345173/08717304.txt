A multi-touch_decision_apparatus__method  and medium are provided. The apparatus includes a sensor to sense an object_contacting a specific_position corresponding to one among a plurality of sensing_channels_arranged in a predetermined_array  a detector to detect at least one of information about signal_strength of the sensing_channel in which the object is sensed and information about the number of sensing_channels having a signal_strength_exceeding a first threshold  and a controller to determine whether a single_touch or a multi_touch has been sensed_based on the detected_information.
