A contact_detecting_device_including  a contact_responding_section_configured to produce an electric_change in response to an object to be detected_coming into contact with or proximity to a detecting_surface  and a contact_driving_scanning_section_configured to scan_application of driving_voltage to the contact_responding_section in one direction within the detecting_surface  and control_output of the electric_change in time_series  wherein the contact_driving_scanning_section_performs a plurality of scans of different regions of the contact_responding_section in parallel with each other  and outputs a plurality of the electric_changes in parallel with each other.
