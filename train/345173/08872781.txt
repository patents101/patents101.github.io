A trackpad_system to filter_movement includes a surface  a sensor_operably_coupled to the surface  a controller_operably_coupled to the sensor  a bus_operably_coupled to the controller  a device_driver_configured to communicate with the bus  and a gesture_module_configured to communicate with the device_driver. The gesture_module includes instructions to determine if each contact_detected on the surface for an input_frame was previously_present on the surface. If the contact was previously_present on the surface  the system_computes  for each axis__position changes for the contact_based on a record associated with the contact. The system_determines if the position changes are unexpected_based on a set of rules. If the position changes are unexpected  the system_suppresses a display of movement associated with the contact for the input_frame for the axis.
