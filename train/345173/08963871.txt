A handheld_device is provided. The handheld_device may include a sensing_unit  a control_unit  an operating_unit  a counting_module and a mode_control_unit. The sensing_unit is for generating a sensing_result_based on whether a user_touch is received or not. The control_unit is for sending out a periodic_pulse to the sensing_unit  and for periodically_charging and discharging the sensing_unit. The counting_module is for counting a pulse_number of the periodic_pulse  and for outputting a counting value when the sensing_result indicates that the user_touch is received. The operating_unit is for generating a mode_control_signal according to the counting value. The mode_control_unit is for controlling the handheld_device to stay in a handheld_mode or a non-handheld_mode according to the mode_control_signal.
