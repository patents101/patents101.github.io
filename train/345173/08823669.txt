A touch_panel includes a display_module  a touch_sensor  an anti-noise_unit and a signal_processing_unit. The display_module_generates a noise. The touch_sensor is disposed above the display_module and outputs an abnormal_signal  wherein the abnormal_signal includes the noise and a sensing_signal. The anti-noise_unit is adapted to receive the abnormal_signal and then reject the noise so as to form the sensing_signal. The signal_processing_unit is adapted to process the sensing_signal.
