The present_invention_relates to a touch_sensing_layer which comprises at least one first-axis_sensing_electrode__second-axis_sensing_electrode__insulating_element and conductive_bridge. Each first-axis_sensing_electrode_comprises a plurality of first electrode_patterns with discontinuity-in-series  and each second-axis_sensing_electrode is configured to interlace with each first-axis_sensing_electrode and comprises a plurality of second electrode_patterns with continuity-in-series. Each insulating_element is continuously_formed on the corresponding second-axis_sensing_electrode  and each conductive_bridge is also continuously_formed above the corresponding first-axis_sensing_electrode and crosses the insulating_element to connect those first electrode_patterns with discontinuity-in-series.
