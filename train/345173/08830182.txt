Methods  systems  and apparatus__including_computer_programs_encoded on computer_storage_media  for resolving_keystrokes_input into an electronic_device. One of the methods includes receiving_multiple_keystrokes in the electronic_device. Multiple characters that correspond to the multiple_keystrokes are stored in a storage_location for a predetermined_time_interval. In response to the predetermined_time_interval_elapsing  the characters that correspond to the multiple_keystrokes are reordered with respect to each other based on a statistical_model.
