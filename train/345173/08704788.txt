A touch_screen_panel and a method of manufacturing the same are disclosed. The touch_screen_panel includes a substrate  an electrode_forming_part_positioned on the substrate  and a routing_wiring_part_positioned on the substrate outside the electrode_forming_part. The electrode_forming_part includes a plurality of first electrode_serials_arranged_parallel to one another in a first direction and a plurality of second electrode_serials_arranged to cross the first electrode_serials. The routing_wiring_part includes a plurality of first routing_wires respectively connected to the first electrode_serials and a plurality of second routing_wires respectively connected to the second electrode_serials. A plurality of first connection_patterns are formed on the same level_layer as the first and second routing_wires to be separated from one another.
