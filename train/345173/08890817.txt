Centralized processing of touch_information_obtained by multiple_touch_sensing_controllers_connected to a touch_sensing_surface is provided. Each touch_controller can obtain_touch_information of sense_signals from different sense_lines of the touch_sensing_surface and can store the touch_information in a corresponding memory of the controller. The touch_information of one or more of the touch_sensing_controllers can be transmitted as results_data to a processor that processes all of the touch_information. In some cases__prior to transfer of the results_data  a determination of the validity of a sense_channel can be made  and invalid_channels can be excluded from the transfer.
