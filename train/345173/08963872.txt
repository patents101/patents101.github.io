A capacitive_type_position_detector is provided  which includes a conductor_pattern_formed of a plurality of conductors_disposed in a first direction and in a second direction_intersecting with the first direction  a transmission_signal_supplying_circuit for supplying a transmission_signal to said plurality of conductors_disposed in the first direction  and a differentially_amplifying_circuit having first and second input_terminals for amplifying_signals_inputted_thereto. The differentially_amplifying_circuit is configured to receive_signals from a set of at least three conductors among said plurality of conductors_disposed in the second direction  to thereby receive_signals from the conductors_located on both end_sides of the set via said first input_terminal and to receive a signal s  from the conductor s  which is are  located between said conductors_located on both end_sides of the set  via said second input_terminal.
