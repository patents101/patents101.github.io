A user_interface for an electronic_device and method for locating an interactive_element having a position along an interactive_surface of a touch_sensitive_interface of an electronic_device are provided. The user_interface has a touch_sensitive_interface  which includes one or more interactive_elements having a position along an interactive_surface  and a surface_sensor  the surface_sensor being adapted for receiving from a user a pattern of interaction with the touch_sensitive_interface at a location along the interactive_surface. The user_interface further includes an alert_device and a controller. The controller includes a user_interaction_detection_module  which is adapted for detecting the location of the pattern of interaction and comparing the location to the position of the one or more interactive_elements. The controller further includes a feedback_module  which is adapted for actuating the alert_device for producing a user_perceivable_alert_signal having a level of alert which is a function of the distance between the location of the pattern of interaction and the position of a closest one of the one or more interactive_elements  wherein as the distance between the location of the pattern of interaction and the position of the closest one of the one or more interactive_elements changes  the level of the alert changes.
