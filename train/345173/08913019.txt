In embodiments of multi-finger_detection and component_resolution__touch_input_sensor_data is recognized as a component of a multi-finger_gesture on a touch-screen_display. An ellipse is determined that approximately_encompasses the component  and the ellipse has a primary_axis and a secondary_axis that are orthogonal. A distribution is then generated that projects_sensor_data_elements from the primary_axis_based on detected_intensity of the touch_input_sensor_data. A histogram_function can then be generated_based on the distribution  where the histogram_function indicates individual_contacts of the component and separation of the individual_contacts.
