A method for adjusting at least a area of a touch_screen wherein the touch_panel_comprises a first touch_area and a second touch_area  the first touch_area is responsive to a stationary_touch and corresponds to a first function  and the second touch_area is responsive to a sliding_touch and corresponds to a second function  includes  defining an overlapped_touch_area_comprising at least part of the first touch_area and at least part of the second touch_area__receiving a touch_input on the touch_panel  when the touch_input is started from the overlapped_touch_area__calculating a moving_distance of the touch_input and a touch_time of the touch_input  and when the touch_time is within a threshold_time  and the moving_distance_exceeds a threshold_distance__setting the overlapped_touch_area to correspond to the second function.
