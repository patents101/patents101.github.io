A method for controlling light-emitting diode  LED  backlight modules applied in an electronic_device is provided. The electronic_device includes a first display and a second display. The second display includes at least two display_areas. Each display_area_corresponds to one LED backlight module  and each display_area_displays_option_icons of an option_type. The method includes  determining the file_type of a file currently displayed on the first display and determining which of the option_types the determined_file_type_corresponds to  determining which of the at least two LED backlight modules the at least one determine_option_type_corresponds to  and outputting_control_signals to turn on at least one of the determined LED backlight modules. A related_electronic_device is also provided.
