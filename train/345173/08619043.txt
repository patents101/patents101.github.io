A touch_screen_display of an electronic_device is calibrated. The method includes receiving_input_comprising_selections of features_registered at the touch_screen_display__filtering the input_based on characteristics_determined during the receiving to determine if the input is to be used for calibrating  for each input used for calibrating__determining a difference between registered_touch_location and a respective_target for the selection and subtracting an offset from the difference  thereby providing remainders of differences for the selections  and calibrating by adjusting a prior_calibration_based on the remainders if the input is determined to be used for calibrating.
