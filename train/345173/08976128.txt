Disclosed is a user_interface that responds to differences in pressure_detected by a touch-sensitive_screen. The user_selects one type of user-interface_action by    lightly____touching the screen and selects another type of action by exerting more pressure. Embodiments can respond to single_touches  to gestural_touches that extend across the face of the touch-sensitive_screen  and to touches in which the user-exerted_pressure_varies during the course of the touch. Some embodiments_respond to how quickly the user changes the amount of pressure_applied. In some embodiments  the location and pressure of the user s input are compared against a stored_gesture_profile. Action is taken only if the input_matches____closely enough    to the stored_gesture_profile. In some embodiments  a notification is sent to the user when the pressure_exceeds a threshold between a light and a heavy_press.
