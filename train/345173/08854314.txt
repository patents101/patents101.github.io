A universal_interface_device_comprises a housing having a curvilinear or other shape  and processing_circuitry_disposed within the housing. The housing_incorporates a sensor_array_substantially_surrounding the processing_circuitry and configured to receive_touch_input from points_distributed over an outer_surface of the housing. The sensor_array_generates_sensor_signals_responsive to the touch_input and the sensor_signals are converted by the processing_circuitry into commands associated with a communication_function_supported by the communication_device. In an illustrative_embodiment  the housing has a spheroidal_shape  and the sensor_array is configured to receive_touch_input from points_distributed over substantially the entire_outer_surface of the housing. The points_distributed over the outer_surface of the housing from which the sensor_array_receives_touch_input are undefined from a point of view of a user providing at least a portion of the touch_input.
