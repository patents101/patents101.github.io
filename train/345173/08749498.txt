A touch_panel and an electronic_device are provided. The touch_panel includes a first substrate  a second substrate that is spaced apart from the first substrate by a gap and includes a contact_surface__driving_electrodes that are formed on each of the first substrate and the second substrate  and electro-rheological_fluid that is disposed in the gap. When a driving_voltage is applied between the driving_electrodes  a button_area is delimited_due to a variation in viscosity of the electro-rheological_fluid at the button_area. When a thickness of the gap is reduced to a value equal to or less than a threshold_due to a pressing_force_applied to the contact_surface at the button_area  the driving_voltage is cut off.
