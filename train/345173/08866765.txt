A manufacturing_method of light_emitting_units is shown below. First step is providing a substrate with multi_circuit_areas. A light_emitting_diode is mounted on the circuit_area respectively. Next step is forming a package_structure to cover the light_emitting_diode. Next step is dicing the package_structure to form a biconic_package_structure. The package_structure is diced twice in two directions  respectively. As above-mentioned  the light_emitting_unit has asymmetric_light_radiation_pattern.
