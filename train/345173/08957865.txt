In some embodiments  an electronic_device with a display and a touch-sensitive_surface_displays a user_interface_object. The device_detects a first contact and a second contact_concurrently on the touch-sensitive_surface. The device_determines which contact of the first contact and the second contact is a topmost_contact  a bottommost_contact  a leftmost_contact  and a rightmost_contact on the touch-sensitive_surface. While continuing to detect the first contact and the second contact  the device_detects_movement of the first contact across the touch-sensitive_surface  and concurrently_moves two edges of the user_interface_object that correspond to the first contact in accordance with the detected_movement of the first contact__including_horizontally_moving one of the two edges and vertically_moving the other of the two edges.
