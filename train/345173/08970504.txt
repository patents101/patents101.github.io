The formation of improved_reliability_conductive_traces in touch_sensor_panels that are less prone to failures_due to environmental_effects is disclosed. Conductive traces  which can be formed from a stackup of metal_layers or a single_metal_layer  can be protected with an additional_photoimageable_passivation_layer of a material such as an organic_polymer. This photoimageable_coating can be patterned so that it does not appear in the visible_area of the touch_sensor_panel  with much finer_tolerances than conventional_passivation_layers to help keep product_dimensions to a minimum.
