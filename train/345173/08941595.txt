A touch_sensor includes conductive_elements of substantially_concave_shape to enable_detection of multiple_simultaneous_touches in at least two directions  with reduced_noise_sensitivity and enhanced_accuracy. The shapes of the conductive_elements may be similar  or may be alternating__complementary_shapes that cover_substantially all of the sensor_area. The conductive_elements_physically_interact with adjacent_elements in such a way that the area_covered by a touch changes monotonically from overlapping_substantially all of one element to overlapping_substantially all of an adjacent_element as the touch_area is moved from one element to the other element along a line between the centers of those adjacent_elements. Such monotonic_change of touch_overlap_area may occur_simultaneously in two orthogonal_directions. Connections from internally_positioned_conductive_elements to a touch_controller may be made to pass through other conductive_elements.
