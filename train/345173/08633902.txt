A multi-touch_plug-in system is described herein that exposes_multi-touch_data for web_application_developers to consume in a platform_independent way. The multi-touch_plug-in system_receives_platform-specific_touch_data from an operating_system or touch_hardware__interprets the platform-specific_touch_data to convert the platform-specific_touch_data to generic_touch_data  and provides the generic_touch_data to a hosted_application_running within a plug-in sandbox. Often  sandboxed_environments only allow identified__trusted_plug-ins to execute. By managing_multi-touch_data within a trusted_plug-in  the plug-in can ensure that hosted_applications are properly_restricted to well-defined_behavior  while still allowing_rich_features such as multi-touch_interaction. Thus  the multi-touch_plug-in system_brings_rich_multi-touch_interaction to a web_browsing_environment.
