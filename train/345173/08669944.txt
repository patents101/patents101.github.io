An electronic_touch_panel includes a plurality of spaced apart first sensor_plates that are arranged in a first direction on a first planar_layer. A proximity_sensor_plate is spaced apart from and attached to the first planar_layer. The proximity_sensor_plate has a greater_surface_area than a plurality of the first sensor_plates. A position_detection_circuit is configured to electrically_charge the first sensor_plates to generate_capacitive_coupling to an adjacent_user_object and to detect_therefrom a location of the user_object_relative to the first direction across the first planar_layer. The position_detection_circuit is further configured to electrically_charge the proximity_sensor_plate to generate a higher_level of capacitive_coupling to the user_object than a plurality of the first sensor_plates and to detect_therefrom a proximity of the user_object_relative to a direction away from the first planar_layer.
