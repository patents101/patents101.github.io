A haptically-enabled_system includes a touch_sensitive_surface and an eccentric rotating mass     ERM     actuator coupled to the touch_sensitive_surface. The ERM actuator includes a motor  a housing and a constrained_mass. The system further includes a drive_circuit that creates a haptic_effect on the touch_sensitive_surface by coupling an alternating_current_signal to the ERM actuator.
