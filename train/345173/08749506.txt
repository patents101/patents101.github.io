A noise_cancellation_circuit includes at least one antenna  a multiplexer  and a readout_circuit. The at least one antenna is used for coupling_noise of a touch_panel and noise of a liquid_crystal_panel_coupled to the touch_panel. The multiplexer is used for receiving first X axis_sensing_signals and first Y axis_sensing_signals of the touch_panel. The readout_circuit is used for utilizing the noise of the touch_panel and the noise of the liquid_crystal_panel to cancel_noise of the touch_panel and noise of the liquid_crystal_panel in the first X axis_sensing_signals and the first Y axis_sensing_signals  and to generate and output second X axis_sensing_signals and second Y axis_sensing_signals not including the noise of the touch_panel and the noise of the liquid_crystal_panel.
