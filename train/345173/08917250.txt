Disclosed herein is a structure of an FPC integrated touch_panel. According to preferred_embodiments of the present_invention  a transparent_substrate_configured of a flexible_transparent_film is provided and an extension_part_protruded to the transparent_substrate is integrally_formed with the transparent_substrate  such that a separate FPC needs not to be manufactured  thereby saving_process_time and manufacturing_costs. In addition  the exemplary_embodiments of the present_invention_bend an inactive_area_unnecessarily_occupying an area of the transparent_substrate to a side of the touch_panel  thereby implementing a touch_panel_widening a substantial_area of an active_region.
