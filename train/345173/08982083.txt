A display_device includes a plurality of first electrodes_arranged on a substrate in parallel in a first direction  a plurality of second electrodes_arranged in parallel in the first direction and a second direction_crossing the first direction without contacting with the plurality of first electrodes  a plurality of first connecting_wires  each first connecting_wire being connected with at least one of the plurality of the first electrodes  and a plurality of second connecting_wires  each second connecting_wire_connecting the second electrodes to each other in the second direction  wherein a touch_driving_voltage is supplied to the plurality of first connecting_wires and a common_voltage is supplied to the plurality of second connecting_wires so that mutual_capacitance is generated between the a plurality of first electrodes and the plurality of second electrodes.
