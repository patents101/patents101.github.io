In embodiments of multi-pass_touch_contact_tracking__touch_input_sensor_data is recognized as a series of components of a contact on a touch-screen_display. The components can be determined to correlate to the contact_based on multi-pass_nearest-neighbor_contact_mapping that includes forward_nearest-neighbor_contact_mapping of the components and reverse_nearest-neighbor_contact_mapping of the components. The components can then be associated to represent a tracking of the contact. Subsequent components of the contact can also be determined and associated with the previous_components of the contact to further represent the tracking of the contact.
