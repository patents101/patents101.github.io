An information_processing_apparatus according to the present_invention is provided which includes a display_panel for displaying a plurality of objects  a plane_area_detection_unit for detecting an operation_tool_positioned on the display_panel and for detecting a plane_area corresponding to the operation_tool on the display_panel  a direction_detection_unit for detecting a moving_direction of the operation_tool_based on variation of position of the plane_area according to time_detected by the plane_area_detection_unit  a contact_determination_unit for determining whether the operation_tool is in contact with the display_panel_based on the plane_area_detected by the plane_area_detection_unit  and an application_control_unit for controlling an application according to a contact_determination_result by the contact_determination_unit and the moving_direction of the operation_tool_detected by the direction_detection_unit.
