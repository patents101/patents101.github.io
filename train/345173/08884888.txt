The disclosed_technology_relates to an electronic_apparatus_including a processor  a touch-sensitive_display  and an accelerometer. An exemplary_method includes receiving in the processor an acceleration value outputted by the accelerometer in response to a user_touching a position on the touch-sensitive_display with a given velocity. The method includes associating the acceleration value with a function  such as the output of a musical_note  indicated by a touched_location on the touch-sensitive_display. The method includes modifying the function  such as audible_volume of the musical_note  in accordance with the acceleration value.
