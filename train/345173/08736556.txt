A method of driving a display_device having a plurality of pixels  a plurality of sensing_units  and a plurality of sense_data_lines to which the plurality of sensing_units are connected  includes  reading_sense_signals from the sense_data_lines__determining whether or not the display has been touched and the number of touches  generating X-axis and Y-axis position data based on the sense_signals  and determining  when the quantity of touches is plural  whether a plurality of touches are sequentially_generated  and the touch_position of each.
