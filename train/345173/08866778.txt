A method of detecting_floating_mode of a touch_panel has steps of reading a sensing_cluster and presetting a detection_window__taking each sensing_point of the sensing_cluster as a center_point of the detection_window  after determining that the center_point has a negative_sensing value qualifying to be generated under a floating_mode  further determining a count of the sensing_points other than the center_point having the sensing_values_generated under a grounding_mode and incrementing an accumulative_number by one if the count_exceeds a first critical value  keeping_incrementing the accumulative_number until each sensing_point in the sensing_cluster has been taken as the center_point of the detection_window for scanning  and determining if the accumulative_number_exceeds a second critical value  and if positive  further determining that the current_sensing_cluster is generated under the floating_mode.
