A touch screen panel Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode  AMOLED  display device for decreasing the thickness of a mobile_terminal and improving a degree of freedom in design is provided. The touch screen panel AMOLED display device includes a flexible AMOLED disposed on the bottom of a window  and a Chip-On-Film  COF  film connected to the flexible AMOLED and coupled with a flexible AMOLED driver Integrated Circuit  IC . Therefore  the thickness of the touch screen panel AMOLED display device may be decreased  and damage of the AMOLED due to an external_shock may be prevented. Additionally  separation of the flexible AMOLED driver IC from a mounting_surface may be prevented.
