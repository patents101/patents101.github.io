Disclosed herein are liquid-crystal display  LCD  touch screens that integrate the touch_sensing_elements with the display_circuitry. The integration may take a variety of forms. Touch sensing elements can be completely_implemented within the LCD stackup but outside the not between the color_filter_plate and the array_plate. Alternatively  some touch_sensing_elements can be between the color_filter and array_plates with other touch_sensing_elements not between the plates. In another alternative  all touch_sensing_elements can be between the color_filter and array_plates. The latter alternative can include both conventional and in-plane-switching  IPS  LCDs. In some forms  one or more display_structures can also have a touch_sensing_function. Techniques for manufacturing and operating such displays  as well as various devices_embodying such displays are also disclosed.
