A multi-touch_system is provided. The multi-touch_system includes a multi-touch_detection_area_generated by a mobile_device and a first communication_device  the mobile_device and first or second communication_device being movable_relative to each other. The mobile_device is operable to determine a first set of coordinates for a first detectable_object within the multi-touch_detection_area as a function of  a distance between the mobile_device and the first communication_device  a distance between the mobile_device and first detectable_object  and a distance between the first communication_device and first detectable_object.
