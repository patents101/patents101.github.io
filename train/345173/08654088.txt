A display includes  a display_section having a plurality of pixels_provided in a region where a first substrate and a second substrate are disposed_opposite to each other  a switch_provided in the region where the first substrate and the second substrate are disposed_opposite to each other  the switch having two electrodes_closed by a pressure from outside  a detecting_section_comparing a signal from the switch with a reference_signal to determine whether the switch is closed or not  and a precharge_section_applying a precharge_potential to a wiring in continuity with one of the electrodes of the switch_prior to the detection at the detecting_section.
