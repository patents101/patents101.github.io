A touch_pad uses a plurality of optical_mouse_type_sensors. The sensors are optimized for detection of motion along the predominant_direction of a user s finger as the finger is moved around the touch_pad. A first one of the sensors_functions to optically_sense_motion in a first direction  while a second one of the sensors_functions to optically_sense_motion in a second  different  direction. The first and second directions are oriented a closed  for example  circular__path.
