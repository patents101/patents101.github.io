The present_invention provides a mutual_capacitive_multi-touch_screen. The conductive_strip_pattern allows that  when a touch_range of each external_conductive_object on the mutual_capacitive_multi-touch_screen is larger than a predetermined_condition__capacitive_coupling between each external_conductive_object and first conductive_strip is greater than capacitive_coupling between each external_conductive_object and second conductive_strip  such that the proportion of a driving_signal_flowing out of the first conductive_strip via at least one first external_conductive_object in the external_conductive_objects and into the second conductive_strip via at least one second external_conductive_object in the external_conductive_objects_decreases as the number of second external_conductive_objects_increases.
