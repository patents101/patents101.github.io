A touch_screen_panel includes a transparent_substrate  a first sensing_electrodes  a second sensing_electrodes  a plurality of first connectors  each of which connects two neighboring first sensing_electrodes  and a plurality of second connectors  each of which connects two neighboring second sensing_electrodes. The touch_screen_panel further includes a electrostatic_induction_member_formed over a touch_inactive_region  the electrostatic_induction_member being electrically_coupled to one of the first sensing_electrodes and extending toward one of the second sensing_electrodes_adjacent to the one of the first sensing_electrodes  at least a portion of the electrostatic_induction_member_overlapping the adjacent second sensing_electrode when viewing in the thickness_direction. A first insulation_layer is interposed between the first connectors and the second connectors and between the electrostatic_induction_member and the adjacent_sensing_electrode.
