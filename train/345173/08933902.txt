In a touch_panel and display_panel_structure or an integrated_touch_display_panel_structure  an antenna_pattern is disposed on a touch_module  a display_module or an integrated_touch_display_module for an increased_distance between the antenna_pattern and electronic_components below the structure__reducing_electromagnetic_effect_caused by the electronic_components and improving the antenna_performance. The antenna_pattern is arranged at two opposite_edges of a top_surface of the touch and display_module or the integrated_touch_display_module  and also at side_surfaces of a housing_non-coplanar to the top_surface such that the antenna_pattern is located outside the displaying_area of the display_module. Maintaining the effective_antenna_area and enhancing the working_bandwidth of the antenna  the side_width of surface of the touch_panel and display_panel_structure or the integrated_touch_display_panel_structure is significantly_reduced.
