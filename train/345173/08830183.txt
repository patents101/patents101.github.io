A liquid crystal display  LCD  with a built-in touch_screen includes  a first substrate_including a pixel_area having a plurality of pixels and a sensor_area having a plurality of photosensors  a second substrate_positioned over the first substrate  and including a color_filter  a light_receiving_portion  a transparent_electrode_layer  and a front_polarizing_plate  an LCD panel including a liquid_crystal_layer_interposed between the first and second substrates  and a touch_screen_driver_circuit to sense a capacitance_variation_provided through a first sensing_line_connected to the transparent_electrode_layer when an object is in contact with the LCD panel  and to output_position_information of the object__sensed by using optical_information_sensed through a second sensing_line_connected the plurality of photosensors when the capacitance_variation is greater than or equal to a predetermined_threshold value.
