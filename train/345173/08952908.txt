A value of a finger_degree_variable_representing a degree of likelihood of a finger is updated at all times in accordance with whether the shape of an input_trajectory_represented by input_coordinate_data is a predetermined_shape  whether a continuous_contact_time indicated by input_coordinate_data is less than a predetermined_time  or whether or not a continuous_non-contact_time indicated by input_coordinate_data is less than a predetermined_time. A degree of smoothening the shape of the input_trajectory is changed in response to the value of the finger_degree_variable.
