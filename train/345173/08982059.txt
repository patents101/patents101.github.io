A touch_panel includes a first electrode_plate having a first conductive_layer and a second electrode_plate_including a second conductive_layer_opposite to the first conductive_layer. At least one of the first conductive_layer and the second conductive_layer includes a carbon_nanotube_film. The carbon_nanotube_film includes a number of thin_regions and at least one normal_region having a number of successively_oriented_carbon_nanotubes_joined_end-to-end by Van der Waals attractive force therebetween. The carbon_nanotubes are substantially_aligned along a same direction. The at least one normal_region has a density of carbon_nanotubes_greater than that of the number of thin_regions  and the number of thin_regions_form at least one row_extending along the aligned_direction of the carbon_nanotubes of the at least one normal_region.
