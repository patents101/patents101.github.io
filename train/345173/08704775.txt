In some embodiments  a touchscreen may display a graphical_user_interface with one or more input_options and may detect which input_options are selected by a user by detecting a user s contact on the touchscreen. The system may determine a new graphical_user_interface_configuration to increase the size and/or spacing of the input_options. In some embodiments  one or more of the input_options may be removed to increase the space available to increase the size of the other input_options. In some embodiments  the system may maintain a history of input_option use to determine which input_options to remove. In some embodiments  the new graphical_user_interface_configuration may include smaller  and/or additional__input_options  e.g.  if the contact_areas are detected as consistently within the displayed_input_options .
