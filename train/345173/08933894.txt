A liquid_crystal_display_device having a built in touch_screen_including a first substrate having pixel_units_comprising  a plurality of pixels_displaying an image and sensor_regions having light_sensors_formed_adjacent to the corresponding pixel_units to sense a position of a contacted_object  a second substrate_disposed on the first substrate__comprising__color_filters_formed on regions corresponding to the pixel_units and first black_matrices_formed on regions corresponding to the sensor_regions of the pixel_units  a liquid_crystal_layer_interposed between the first substrate and the second substrate  and a backlight_assembly_disposed on a bottom_portion of the first substrate and providing light to the first substrate and the second substrate. The liquid_crystal_display_device with the built in touch_screen_determines a point of contact on the touch_screen.
