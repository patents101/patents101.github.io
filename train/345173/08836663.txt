A touch_sensitive_device includes a touch_sensitive_panel for providing a tactile_user_interface_including at least one tactile_object  a sensor_unit_configured to detect_contact with the touch_sensitive_panel and generate_contact_region_information of a contact_region in which the contact is detected  a tactile_feedback_unit_configured to generate_tactile_feedback of a mini-map of the tactile_user_interface in the contact_region indicated by the generated_contact_region_information  and a controller_configured to control the touch_sensitive_panel  the sensor_unit  the tactile_feedback_unit and the tactile_user_interface. The mini-map of the tactile_user_interface includes a duplicate of the tactile_object_provided on the touch_sensitive_panel  and the duplicate of the tactile_object indicates a direction from the contact_region indicated by the contact_region_information to the tactile_object.
