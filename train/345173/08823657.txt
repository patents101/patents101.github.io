Touch sensing can be accomplished using master/slave_touch_controllers that transmit_drive_signals to a touch_surface and process_sense_signals_including_superpositions_resulting from master/slave_drive_signals. The master/slave can drive and sense different sets of lines  respectively  of the touch_surface. A communication_link between master/slave can be established by transmitting a clock_signal between master/slave__transmitting a command_including_sequence_information to the slave  and initiating a communication_sequence from the clock_signal and sequence_information. The slave can receive/transmit_communications from/to the master during first/second portions of the communication_sequence  respectively. Touch sensing operations can be synchronized between master/slave by transmitting a command_including_phase_alignment_information from master to slave  and generating_slave_clock_signals_based on the clock_signal and the phase_alignment_information  such that sense_signal_processing by master_clock_signals are in-phase with sense_signal_processing by slave_clock_signals.
