Techniques are provided for outputting_entries from supplemental_content  e.g.  such as reference_works__based on an amount of force_applied to a touch-sensitive_display of a device. For example  a user_reading an electronic book  eBook  on a device having a touch-sensitive_display may select a word or a phrase within the eBook by touching the display at a location of the word or the phrase. The techniques may determine one or more entries from the supplemental_content to output_based on a measured_amount of force of the selection. To illustrate  the device may output a dictionary_definition of the selected_word in response to measuring a first amount of force or output a thesaurus_entry for the word in response to measuring a second amount of force.
