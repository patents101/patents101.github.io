A first resistive_film is arranged such that one edge_thereof is connected to a first terminal  and an edge that is opposite to the aforementioned_edge is connected to a second terminal. A second resistive_film is arranged with a gap between it and the first resistive_film such that one edge_thereof is connected to a third terminal. A voltage_generating_unit_applies a predetermined first bias_voltage and a predetermined second bias_voltage to the first terminal and the second terminal  respectively. A voltage_detection_unit_detects a panel_voltage that occurs at the third terminal. A current_detection_unit_detects a panel_current that flows through a path_including the first terminal  the first resistive_film  and the second terminal. A computation_unit_determines the coordinates_touched by the user__based upon the values of the panel_voltage and the panel_current.
