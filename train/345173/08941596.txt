A touch_screen and a manufacturing_method_thereof  and a color_filter_substrate and a manufacturing_method_thereof are provided in the invention. The touch_screen_comprises a substrate  a plurality of touch_regions_defined by a plurality of first signal_lines and a plurality of second signal_lines are provided on the substrate. In each touch_region  the first signal_line is connected with a first piezoelectric_switch  the second signal_line is connected with a second piezoelectric_switch  when the touch_region is touched by a force the first piezoelectric_switch and the second piezoelectric_switch are turned on and transfer_voltage_signals respectively via the first signal_line and the second signal_line to determine the coordinate of the touched_touch_region.
