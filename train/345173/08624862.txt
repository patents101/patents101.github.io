A method for making a touch_panel is provided. The method includes providing at least one array of carbon_nanotubes  a first substrate  and a second substrate. The at least one array of carbon_nanotubes is pressed by using a pressing_device to form a carbon_nanotube_structure. A first electrode_plate is formed on the first substrate and a second electrode_plate on the second substrate. Two first-electrodes are located on opposite_sides of the first electrode_plate and two second-electrodes on opposite_sides of the second electrode_plate. The first electrode_plate is spaced a distance from the second electrode_plate such that the first conductive_layer and the second conductive_layer_face each other.
