The invention provides a sensing_method for a portable_device with a touch_panel. The touch_panel is sequentially_divided into a valid_input_region  a transition_region and a peripheral_region from a center to a periphery of the touch_panel. The sensing_method_comprises_sensing a contact_signal_generated from a contact_motion of an input_device on the touch_panel. When the initial_position of the contact_motion is determined to be within one of the valid_input_region and the transition_region according to the contact_signal or the initial_position of the contact_motion is determined to be within the peripheral_region and the contact_motion_moves into the valid_input_region according to the contact_signal  an operation corresponding to the contact_motion is executed according to the contact_signal.
