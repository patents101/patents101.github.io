A setting_operation_support_device includes an operation_target_object among components_constituting a substrate_processing_apparatus  an operation_setting of which can be selected  a simulator that simulates an operation of the operation_target_object  a touch-panel_type_operator_operation_display_unit and a touch-panel_type_simulation_operation_display_unit and a function_setting_button. The correlation between the operation_target_object and a screen_related to its operation_settings is stored in advance in a screen_storage_unit. As the function_setting_button is first depressed and then the operation_target_object is specified through a touch_operation while a dynamic_image of the operation_target_object is on display at the operator_operation_display_unit  the setting_screen_correlated to the particular operation_target_object is searched at the screen_storage_unit and is brought up on display at the operator_operation_display_unit.
