Disclosed are a device and a method of sensing a touch using an oscillation_circuit. Touch sensor lines that detect a position by using a resistor and a capacitor of an RC oscillation_circuit face each other to make_pairs in a panel  and an oscillation_frequency_generated according to capacitance of the panel which is changed by a touch is measured through the adjacent_touch_sensor_lines and two or more characteristics of the measured_oscillation_frequency are calculated to determine the touched_position.
