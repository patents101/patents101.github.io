A touchscreen may be calibrated using a second sensor that may be placed around the periphery of the touchscreen in a known position with respect to the touchscreen. The second sensor may be incorporated into a bezel and may have one or more sensor_elements. The second sensor may be used to sense the position of a user s finger or stylus when the user_touches an object on the touchscreen_display  and the second sensor_output may be used to update a calibration_factor_based on the position of the displayed_object. The second sensor may be used to periodically_recalibrate the touchscreen any time an object is selected in proximity to the second sensor.
