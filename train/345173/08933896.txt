In an indirect_interaction_input_device__z-information can be considered in defining a user_interaction_model for the device. Any measurement of displacement in a z-direction can be used  if such information is available from the input_device. The pressure_data can be used to define_states of interaction  with transitions between these states_determined by various thresholds. The device can provide_raw or normalized_data  and can provide_state_information or data_defining its thresholds that specify state_transitions. This information can be provided as an attribute of a contact_point_provided by the device. Data can be normalized across various similar_devices. Applications can use the raw_pressure_data from the device for their own purposes  or rely on the device itself or host_operating_system_software to interpret the pressure_data according to thresholds and states.
