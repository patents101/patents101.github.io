An optical_plate_structure for a touch_panel includes an optical_plate  at least a light_source  and at least an optical_camera. A light-emitting_surface of the optical_plate includes a plurality of micro-structure. The light_source is disposed beside a vertical_side of the optical_plate and emits a first light_entering the optical_plate. The optical_plate_guides the first light and emits a second light from the light-emitting_surface. The optical_camera is disposed beside the optical_plate or in a corner of the optical_plate and above the light-emitting_surface  for detecting a third light_incident on the light_camera. The second light is reflected by an object_touching the optical_plate to become the third light. The optical_plate_structure for a touch_panel may be utilized in a touch_display_panel or a touch_liquid_crystal_display_panel.
