The present_invention_discloses a method for controlling in realtime_fashion_multimedia_contents on a second screen at a TX side from a first screen at a RX side. The method_comprising__detecting at least one touch_signal via the first screen  and converting the at least one touch_signal into touch_data associated with a first position_information_defining a virtual_operation on the first screen corresponding to an actual_operation on the second screen  the first position_information being with respect to a first coordinate_system of the first screen__transmitting the touch_data of the RX side to the TX side via the network_communication  and calculating at the TX side a second position_information with respect to a second coordinate_system of the second screen_based on the first position_information  and performing the actual_operation at the second screen_based on the second position_information.
