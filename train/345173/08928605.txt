An electrode and an isolation_layer of a touch_device are the same color  so that a user of the touch_device_perceives a good_visual_effect without having to employ_expensive_optical_adhesive and decorative_films in the touch_device. The front_bezel_design used in conventional_touch_devices can thus be abandoned. Further  simpler_fabrication__higher_yield_rate  and lower_cost are also achieved.
