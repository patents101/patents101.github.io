An input_apparatus has a touch_sensor__11__configured to detect a touch_input  a piezoelectric_element__13__mounted on the touch_sensor__11   a load_detection_unit__18__configured to detect a pressure_load on a touch_face__11 a  of the touch_sensor__11__based on an output of the piezoelectric_element__13  and to determine whether the pressure_load_satisfies a standard to provide a tactile_sensation  and a piezoelectric_element_drive_unit__15__configured to drive the piezoelectric_element__13   when the load_detection_unit__18__determines that the pressure_load_satisfies the standard  such that the tactile_sensation is provided to an object_pressing the touch_face__11 . The load_detection_unit__18__resumes_detection of the pressure_load after a predetermined_period from drive of the piezoelectric_element__13  by the piezoelectric_element_drive_unit__15.
