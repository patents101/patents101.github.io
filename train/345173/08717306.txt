In a touch_panel and a display_apparatus having the touch_panel  the touch_panel includes a plurality of sensor_lines  a plurality of sensor_switches  a line_selecting_unit and a sensor_resistor_section. The sensor_switches are electrically_connected to the sensor_lines  respectively  and apply_sensing_signals to the sensor_lines  respectively  when a touch_event_occurs. The line_selecting_unit is electrically_connected to end_portions of the sensor_lines and sequentially_outputs the sensing_signals_transferred through the sensor_lines. The sensor_resistor_section includes a first end_electrically_connected to the sensor_lines  respectively  and a second end_opposite to the first end. The second end_receives a driving direct current  DC  voltage. Therefore  the touch_panel may have an improved_ability to detect_touch_events.
