An electronic_apparatus includes an input_interface  a controller and a processor. The input_interface includes a central_touch_sensing_region and a peripheral_touch_sensing_region. The central_touch_sensing_region has a central_touch_pad_disposed therein  and the peripheral_sensing_region_surrounds the central_touch_sensing_region and includes a plurality of peripheral_touch_pads_disposed therein. The controller is configured for detecting a touch on the central_touch_pad and at least one of the peripheral_touch_pads and generating a central_detecting_signal and at least one peripheral_detecting_signal. The processor is electrically_coupled to the controller. When receiving the central_detecting_signal and the at least one peripheral_detecting_signal  the processor_performs a corresponding function according to the variation of signal_strengths of the central_detecting_signal and the peripheral_detecting_signal.
