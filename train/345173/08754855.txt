Embodiments described herein are directed to simultaneously_presenting a virtual_touchpad and a graphical_user_interface of an operating_system on the same display. A user can interact with the OS using the virtual_touchpad  and user_touches are read by a touch-screen_portion of the display_assigned to the touchpad. Touch input software converts touch packets from user_touches into data_packets_relevant to the screen and display_resolution of either the display or a portion of the display_presenting the OS. Gesture-recognition software applies rules to the converted_packets to determine which actions the user_meant by the touches. And an application_controlling a mouse_cursor_manipulates the mouse_cursor according to the mouse_actions.
