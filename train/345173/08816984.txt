A multipoint_touch_surface_controller is disclosed herein. The controller includes an integrated_circuit_including_output_circuitry for driving a capacitive_multi-touch_sensor and input_circuitry for reading the sensor. Also disclosed herein are various noise_rejection and dynamic_range_enhancement_techniques that permit the controller to be used with various sensors in various conditions without reconfiguring_hardware.
