Extended touchscreen pattern. A conductive_pattern_implemented within a touchscreen  e.g.  using indium tin oxide  ITO  such as may be deposited on a substrate_composed of polyester or some other material  provides paths for signals_traveling through the touchscreen. By monitoring these signal in accordance with some means  e.g.  cross_point_detection__zone_detection  etc.  an estimate may be made as to a location of user s interaction with the touchscreen  e.g.  finger or stylus_touching of the touchscreen . The conductive_pattern includes a number of conductors_aligned in various directions  e.g.  row and column_conductors  across the touchscreen  and they may be co-planar or separated by a dielectric_material. A conductor_aligned in one direction includes one or more extended_areas that complementarily_align with a conductor_aligned in another direction. The extended_areas of one conductor may be viewed as filling_voids  e.g.  holes__notches  etc.  of another conductor.
