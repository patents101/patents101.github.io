A mobile_communication_terminal__100  has a touch_panel_unit__150  as an input_unit. Touch detection is performed by scanning_detection_signals from the touch_panel_unit__150  at a given operation_frequency. A radio_device__120__performs_communication such as cellular_communication and reception of broadcast such as digital_broadcast. When the radio_device__120__performs_radio_transmission/reception_operation  a touch_detection_processing_unit__112__identifies an operation_frequency of the touch_panel_unit__150  that is not interfered by the frequency of radio_transmission/reception by the radio_device__120  and a touch_panel_control_unit__111__controls the touch_panel_unit__150  to scan it at that operation_frequency.
