Noise reduction in a one- or two-dimensional_capacitive_sensor_array is achieved by rejecting and re-acquiring_noisy_signals. The sensor_array is formed of crossed X and Y lines for drive and sense_functions respectively  each of the X lines being driven in turn to acquire a full_frame of data from the sensor_array. A controller_actuates the X lines in turn and  for each X line__charge is transferred to charge_measurement_capacitors_connected to respective ones of the Y lines. The controller_measures a signal value from a first one of the measurement_capacitors  and then tests if that Y signal value has a magnitude_lying within an acceptable_range. If not  the measurement_capacitors are all reset without their signal_values being measured  and the controller_re-drives the same X line to initiate another charge_transfer into the measurement_capacitors for that X line. It is then attempted once again to acquire Y signal_values for that X line. Noisy signal_values are thus rejected  and the sensor_re-acquires_substitute_signal_values. This is distinct from the approach of acquiring_data and then reprocessing it to remove or suppress_noisy_data as in the prior_art.
