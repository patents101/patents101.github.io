Various embodiments of a capacitive_touchscreen_system and corresponding methods are described. A touchscreen_controller is operably_connected to a first plurality of drive_electrodes  a second plurality of sense_electrodes  and a host_processor. The touchscreen_controller has computer-readable_button_group_programming_instructions and data_loaded into a first memory_portion_thereof from the host_processor that comprise_steps for sensing and arbitrating among touches_occurring on and within a first plurality of buttons. Firmware instructions and data are loaded into a second portion of the memory of the touchscreen_controller. The first plurality of buttons is arranged in a first group on the touchscreen  and the first group is located within a first portion of the touchscreen. Capacitive sensing of touches_occurring on and within at least second portions of the touchscreen that are located outside the first portion of the touchscreen are controlled by the firmware_instructions.
