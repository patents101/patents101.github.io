A position_detector is provided_including  a transmission_signal_supplying_circuit for supplying a transmission_signal to a plurality of conductors_disposed in a first direction  a first conductor_selecting_circuit for supplying the transmission_signal_outputted from the transmission_signal_supplying_circuit to a predetermined_conductor s  of the plurality of conductors_disposed in the first direction  a differentially_amplifying_circuit for differentially_amplifying_signals_inputted_thereto through its first and second input_terminals  respectively  and outputting a resulting_signal  and a second conductor_selecting_circuit for selecting a plurality of conductors_including at least three conductors_located_close to one another in a plurality of conductors_disposed in a second direction_intersecting with the first direction__supplying_signals from the conductors_located on both end_sides of the plurality of conductors thus selected to the first input_terminal  and supplying a signal s  from the conductor s  other than the conductors_located on both end_sides  respectively  to the second input_terminal.
