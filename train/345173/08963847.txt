One embodiment of the present_invention_sets forth a technique for controlling the operations of a consumer electronic  CE  device. A system includes a display_device  CE device  and a remote_controller with a touchpad. The CE device is configured to output a context-specific_user_interface for display by the display_device. The particular user_interface_varies_based on the operational_context of the CE device. The remote_controller_sends_signals that are detected by the CE device and control_operations_performed by the CE device. More specifically  the remote_controller is used as a handheld_pointing_device to select_operations through interactions with the context-specific_user_interface. A user may apply_gestures to the touchpad that are interpreted_based on the context-specific_user_interface to control the CE device.
