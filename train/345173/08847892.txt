An apparatus for user_interfaces is described to measure_inductively the deformation of a body___1___comprising at least two laminar_conductive_elements___3__4   at least one of which is an AC energized inductor   4   wherein deformation causes relative_axial_movement between the at least two laminar_elements___3__4   and the maximum_deformation_distance is limited to prevent_damage.
