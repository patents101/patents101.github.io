Disclosed is a display_device. The display_device includes a panel  a display_driver IC  and a touch IC. The panel includes a plurality of driving_electrodes and a plurality of sensing_electrodes. The display_driver IC outputs a common_voltage to the driving_electrode and the sensing_electrode in a display_driving_interval__outputs a reference_voltage to the driving_electrode during a touch_non-sensing_period in a touch_driving_interval  and outputs a driving_pulse to the driving_electrode to receive a sensing_signal from the sensing_electrode during a touch_sensing_period in the touch_driving_interval. The touch IC transfers a control_signal and a selection_signal for selecting the touch_sensing_period and the touch_non-sensing_period to the display_driver  and senses whether there is a touch with the sensing_signal and the reference_voltage.
