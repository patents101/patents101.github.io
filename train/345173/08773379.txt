A touch_sensing_apparatus is disclosed. The touch_sensing_apparatus includes a logic_control_module  at least one storage_control_module  and at least one decoding_control_module. The logic_control_module is used to generate a plurality of control_signals having different control_timings. The plurality of control_signals includes a storage_control_signal and a decoding_control_signal. Each storage_control_module includes a plurality of storage_capacitors  and respectively stores each of sensed_voltages in different storage_capacitors at different times according to a storage_control_timing of the storage_control_signal. The sensed_voltages are analog_data_sensed from scan_lines of an ITO sensor. The decoding_control_module is used to decode the sensed_voltages_stored in the storage_capacitors according to a decoding_control_timing of the decoding_control_signal to output the decoded_analog_data.
