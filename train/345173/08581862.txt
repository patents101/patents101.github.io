In a liquid_crystal_display_device in which a front_window and a touch_panel are bonded together with an adhesive_sheet  a logo having plural_layers is formed on a back_side of the front_window. A touch-panel_flexible_wiring_substrate is mounted to the touch_panel. A plane_distance between an end_portion of the plural_layers of the logo and an end_portion of the touch_panel is set to greater than zero. With this configuration  it is possible to prevent a peeling_stress on the adhesive_sheet  even if a thickness of the adhesive_sheet is smaller than the sum of a thickness of the touch-panel_flexible_wiring_substrate and a thickness of the logo.
