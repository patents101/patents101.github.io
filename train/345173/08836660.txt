Provided is a technique_capable of allowing a person to perceive a fine_relief on an object_surface clearly. A tactile_device of a tactile_display_slides above an object. The tactile_device_comprises three rods which are free to move up and down. Lower ends of the rods are in contact with a surface of the object. Upper ends of respective_rods_touch a palmar-side_skin_equivalent to positions of three joints of a first finger or a second finger. When the tactile_device is slid__upper_ends of respective_rods_move up and down in accordance with a surface_relief of the object. In response to the movement of the tactile_device  the three rods_push three finger_joint_positions of the palmar-side_skin with a stroke_equal to a height of the relief.
