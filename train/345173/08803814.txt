A scanning_capability for capacitive_touch_screen_devices is disclosed. Images  such as text__barcodes  or the like are printed on printed_objects  such as business_cards__information_cards  and the like using electrically_conductive_ink that has had electrical_properties_imparted_thereon such that  when the printed_object comes in contact with the touch_screen of a capacitive_touch_screen_device  the imparted_electrical_properties are sufficient to cause variances in capacitance to the touch_screen that are detectable by the device. Using these detected_touches  the scanning_system_analyzes any patterns_created by the detected_touches to determine_information_represented by those patterns and corresponding to the information_represented by the images_printed on the printed_object.
