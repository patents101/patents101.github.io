Provided is a touch_panel_including  a plurality of scanning_electrodes_formed on a display_panel  a plurality of detecting_electrodes_intersecting with the plurality of scanning_electrodes  the plurality of detecting_electrodes being formed on the display_panel  a first unit for sequentially_connecting a constant_current_source to each of the plurality of scanning_electrodes for each one scanning_period  and a second unit for detecting a touch_position on the display_panel_based on a variation of a current_detected at each of the plurality of detecting_electrodes. One of the each of the plurality of scanning_electrodes and the each of the plurality of detecting_electrodes is formed on the display_panel_surface on a viewer_side  and another of the each of the plurality of scanning_electrodes and the each of the plurality of detecting_electrodes is formed_inside the display_panel.
