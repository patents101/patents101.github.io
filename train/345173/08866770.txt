An embodiment provides a method of controlling a touch_screen. The touch_screen_displays an interactive_frame within a touch_permissible_region. Under the method  the touch_screen can be switched from a normal_state into a shrunk_state. When the touch_screen is in the shrunk_state  the touch_permissible_region is confined to a sub-region of the touch_screen. In contrast  when the touch_screen is in the normal_state  the touch_permissible_region_extends beyond the sub-region.
