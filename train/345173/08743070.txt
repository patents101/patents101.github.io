A touch_panel is constructed by a display/sensor_unit which is slightly_larger than a display_screen of an LCD and a sensor_unit which is projected to the outside from one side  for example  from one side on the right. A finger of the user is touched to a selection_item such as desired_button__icon  or the like on the display/sensor_unit and vertically_moved on the sensor_unit. A selection_display_constructed by a plurality of buttons is displayed along the side of the display_screen by the LCD. A button beside the finger is highlighted. When the finger is released  the highlighted_button is selected. If there are no buttons_adjacent to the finger  the button is not highlighted. Even if the finger is released  the state is not changed. When finger is moved to the display/sensor_unit  the selection_display_disappears.
