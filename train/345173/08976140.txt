A touch_coordinate_acquisition_unit_acquires the coordinate_position of a touch_point on a touch_panel. An area_determination_unit_determines whether or not the coordinate_position of a touch_point is present within an enlarging_operation_area_provided in part of the touch_panel. A drag_determination_unit_determines if a touch_point has been dragged. When the coordinate_position of a touch_point is present within the enlarging_operation_area and the touch_point has been dragged  an operation_mode_switching_unit_switches the operation_mode for touch_inputs from a normal_operation_mode to an enlarging_operation_mode. When the operation_mode is switched to the enlarging_operation_mode  a touch_coordinate_transformation_unit_transforms the coordinates of an actual_touch_point within the enlarging_operation_area into the coordinates of a virtual_touch_point for the whole area of the touch_panel.
