A touch_sensing_device is provided. The provided_touch_sensing_device may include a touch_sensing_circuit having a conducting_unit for generating an alternating current  AC  touch signal  a phase_delaying_circuit_electrically_coupled to the touch_sensing_circuit for receiving the AC touch signal and delaying the AC touch signal for a predetermined_phase so as to derive a delayed_signal  and a determination_circuit_electrically_coupled to the touch_sensing_circuit and the phase_delaying_circuit for comparing_intensities of the delayed_signal and the AC touch signal with a predetermined_threshold in order to derive a waveform-overlapping_time_period. When the waveform-overlapping_time_period is longer than a predetermined_period  the determination_circuit_concludes the conducting_unit is approached or contacted by the conductor.
