Embodiments of the invention_relate to correction of erroneous_touch_data on a touch_sensor_panel. Erroneous touch data may occur when a user is touching_locations on the touch_sensor_panel but fails to be in good_contact with another part of the device_including the touch_sensor_panel. These erroneous_readings may be statistically_compensated for. A capacitance value that combines various external_capacitances that may cause erroneous_results can be calculated. Then  if necessary  received_touch_data can be modified to take into account the external_capacitance. Accordingly  improved_accuracy is provided for determining_touch_event s  on a touch_sensor_panel.
