A touch_sensing_apparatus_utilizes the characteristics of orthogonal_vectors is disclosed. A random spread spectrum  RSS  signal or a periodic_wave is used to modulate a driving_signal so as to driving a row of a sensing_array  and the RSS signal or periodic_wave is also use to extract_touch_information of a node from a sensing_signal_measured from a column of the sensing_array. The node is an intersection of the driven_row and the measured_column. When different RSS signals and/or periodic_waves are used to drive_multiple_rows_simultaneously__multipoint_touching_information can be obtained from the same sensing_signal at the same time by respectively using the RSS signals and/or periodic_waves to extract_touching_information of multiple_points which are the intersections of the driven_rows and the measured_column.
