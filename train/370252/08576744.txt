A system and method to intercept_traffic at standard_interface_points as defined by Cellular/Wireless networks  GSM/GPRS  3G/UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA  CDMA  WIMAX  LTE  emulate the respective_protocols on either side of the interception_point__extract_user/application_payloads within the intercepted_packets__perform_optimizations  and re-encapsulate with the same protocol  and deliver the content_transparently is disclosed. The optimizations include but are not limited to Content Caching  prediction     pre-fetching of frequently used content__performance of content-aware transport optimizations  TCP  UDP  RTP etc.  for reducing_back-haul_bandwidth  and improvement of user_experience. An additional_embodiment of the current_invention includes injecting_opportunistic_content__location_based__profile_based or advertisement_content__based on the information_derived while monitoring_control_plane_protocols.
