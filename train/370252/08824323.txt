A method__apparatus and computer_program_product for providing wireless_control_plane_failover_handling in a split-plane_deployment is presented. A first AP in a split-plane_deployment_detects_failure of a Wireless Control Plane  WCP  device. The first AP hides an SSID in beacons_broadcast by the first AP. The first AP stores information for existing Mobile Units  MUs  that dissociate after the detection of the failure of the WCP device. The first AP will respond to probes from existing MUs  and also respond to probes from MUs that have their information_stored in the AP  such that the first AP appears hidden from new MUs while being exposed to existing MUs.
