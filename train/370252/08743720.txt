Disclosed are channel_management_methods in a multicarrier_structure in a mobile_communication_system. Uplink  UL  and downlink  DL  channel_management_methods in a carrier_aggregation_environment are used as the channel_management_methods. In DL  a base_station_determines a component carrier  CC  of an unstable_radio_channel_state__stops_data_retransmission by the CC  and notifies a terminal of retransmission_stop. In UL  the base_station_determines a CC of an unstable_radio_channel_state and instructs the terminal to stop_data_retransmission by the CC  and the terminal_stops the data_retransmission and initializes a retransmission_buffer. Using the channel_management_methods in the mobile_communication_system_employing the multicarrier_structure  an increase in the number of unnecessary_retransmissions is prevented  so that unnecessary_retransmission and power_consumption of the terminal can be reduced and the waste of radio_resources and the degradation of base_station_performance_due to unnecessary_retransmission can be prevented.
