Various methods__systems  and computer_program_products are disclosed for determining_effects of non-network_elements on resource_utilization. According to various implementations of the invention  a method may include receiving_traffic_data. The method may include associating the network_traffic_data with a non-network_element  which may operate on the mobile_network but are not part of an infrastructure of the mobile_network. The method may include determining a first communication_procedure used by the one or more non-network_elements_based on the associated network_traffic_data. The method may include determining a utilization of network_resources by the one or more non-network_elements_based on the first communication_procedure. The network may further include determining a change in the utilization of network_resources_based on a second communication_procedure.
