Techniques for controlling_transmit_power of a terminal are described. The terminal may send a first transmission  e.g.  for pilot or signaling  on the reverse_link__receive_feedback  e.g.  a power_control_command or an erasure_indicator  for the first transmission  and adjust a reference_power_level_based on the feedback. The terminal may also receive_interference_information and possibly other parameters such as a pilot quality indicator  PQI  an offset_factor  and a boost_factor from a sector. The terminal may determine_transmit_power for a second transmission to the sector_based on the interference_information  the reference_power_level  and/or the other parameters. The terminal may receive the feedback from one sector and may send the second transmission with CDMA or OFDMA to the same sector or a different sector.
