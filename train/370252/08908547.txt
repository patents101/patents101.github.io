A method of controlling the codec_mode of a convergence internet protocol  IP  network and a terminal using the method are provided. The terminal may include a variable_bit-rate/mode_codec_controller_including a channel_status_measurement and management  CSMM  unit which measures the status of a wireless_channel and provides the results of the measuring of the wireless_channel_status as channel_quality_information  and which measures the transfer_performance of a received_packet and provides the results of the measuring of the packet_transfer_performance as packet_measurement_parameter_information  and a service quality control  SQC  unit which measures the quality of a multimedia_service_based on the channel_quality_information and the packet_measurement_parameter_information  provides the results of the measuring of the multimedia_service_quality as service_quality_information and determines a codec_mode of the terminal or a counterpart_terminal_communicating with the all-IP terminal based on the service_quality_information. Therefore  it is possible to improve the quality of multimedia_services.
