A method is intended for computing_online_channel_loss_rate and collision_loss_rate of at least one communication_link_established between nodes of a network using a random access MAC protocol. This method_comprises the steps of i  dividing_time in probing_windows and transmitting a chosen_number S of probe_packets during each probing_window from a transmitter_node to a receiver_node_linked_therebetween__ii__measuring a packet_loss_rate from probe_packets_lost on this communication_link during a probing_window__iii__scanning each probing_window with smaller_sliding_windows  each having a size Wk smaller than S  to identify the sliding_window during which only channel_losses_occur  and then for computing a channel_loss_rate on this communication_link from this identified_sliding_window  and iv__computing a collision_loss_rate on this communication_link by subtracting the computed_channel_loss_rate from the measured_packet_loss_rate.
