The present_disclosure provides an antenna_array_control_method and an access_point using the same. The antenna_array_control_method may include the following steps. At least a packet is selected as at least a probing_packet every probing_period. One of the radiation_patterns to be probed in an antenna_array is used to transmit the probing_packet. The packet_error_rates of the radiation_patterns to be probed in the antenna_array are calculated. The radiation_pattern with a minimum_packet_error_rate among all of the radiation_patterns is selected as a best radiation_pattern.
