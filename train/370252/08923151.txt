A moving_image_transmission_system_determines_adequate_number of packets  which are corresponding to redundant_portion  in accordance with a network_state. The moving_image_transmission_system_estimates a correlation between a transmission_bit_rate and a packet_loss_rate_based on both of information which indicates the packet_loss_rate and bit_rate_information  and determines the packet_loss_rate  which makes an encode_bit_rate of moving_image_data_maximum__based on the correlation  and determines_redundancy  which is applied to the moving_image_data__based on the determined_packet_loss.
