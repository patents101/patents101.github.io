A combination of a phase_shifter  a measurement_receiver  and an offset_estimator_enable the d.c. offset in the transmit_path of a quadrature_transmitter to be distinguished from the d.c. offset in the measurement_receiver. The measurement_receiver_performs a first measurement on the transmit_path_output with a    normal____phase_shift of 0_degrees and 90_degrees for in-phase  I  and quadrature  Q  components  and a second measurement with a    special____phase_shift for the I and Q components. In one embodiment  the    special____phase_shift for the I and Q components is 180_degrees and 270_degrees  respectively.
