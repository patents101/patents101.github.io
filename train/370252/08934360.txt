The present_invention_discloses a method  a terminal and a network_system for reporting a buffer_status_report. The method_comprises  a terminal_triggers a buffer_status_report  BSR  and obtains_radio_resource_information of uplink_component_carriers in a radio_network  one or more BSR data units are constructed_based on information of buffer_data_volume to be transmitted  one or more uplink_component_carriers are selected from the uplink_component_carriers with available radio_resources  and the BSR data unit s  is/are transmitted on the selected_uplink_component_carrier s  to a network_side. The present_invention_fully_takes_advantages of wide_bandwidth of a long term evolution-advanced  LTE -A system  and can realize_high-efficiency-and-quality_transmission of BSR data unit s .
