Provided are a cognitive radio  CR  cooperative spectrum sensing method and a fusion center  FC  performing CR cooperative spectrum sensing. The CR cooperative spectrum sensing method includes receiving  at an FC  local spectrum sensing information about a predetermined_frequency_band from each of N secondary users  SUs  in a predetermined_zone__determining  at the FC  the optimum_number of SUs for determining whether the predetermined_frequency_band is being used by a primary user  PU  on the basis of the received_local_spectrum_sensing_information  and performing_cooperative_spectrum_sensing on the basis of local_spectrum_sensing_information_received from the optimum_number of SUs in the predetermined_zone. The method is implemented by the FC. Accordingly  the method and FC find how many SUs are needed to determine that a frequency of a PU is being used in a corresponding-channel_situation  thereby enabling_efficient_communication.
