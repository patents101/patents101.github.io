Methods and devices for characterizing the interconnection_efficiency of a computer_network_based upon a static_routing_scheme are disclosed. The network_comprises a plurality of items of equipment. After having determined___105   a plurality of types of links between said items of equipment  a theoretical_number of routes per link and the associated number of links are determined___120__125   for each type of at least one subset of said plurality of types of links according to the topology of said network. The determined_theoretical_number of routes per link and the associated number of links are then aggregated___135   to estimate at least one optimal_routing_point_characterizing the theoretical_efficiency of the network. Such optimal_routing_points can be compared with estimated_actual_routing_points_based upon the aggregation of actual_numbers of routed per link and associated actual_numbers of links to characterizes the network_efficiency.
