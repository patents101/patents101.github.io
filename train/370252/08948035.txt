A terminal_speed_identification_unit_identifies the moving_speed of a wireless_terminal currently in communication. A ranging_control_unit_sets the transmission_cycle of a ranging_signal of a wireless_terminal_moving at a speed_greater than or equal to a predetermined_speed_shorter than the transmission_cycle of a ranging_signal of a wireless_terminal_moving at a speed below the predetermined_speed. A transmission_unit_transmits a signal_notifying the transmission_cycle of a ranging_signal to the wireless_terminal. A reception_unit_receives a ranging_signal from a wireless_terminal currently in communication.
