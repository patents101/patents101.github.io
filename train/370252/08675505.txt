Methods and apparatus for efficient_network_information_acquisition over a DVB network. In an aspect  a method includes identifying an IP/MAC platform  acquiring_network_information table  NIT  information in a transport_stream being transmitted on a forward link frequency  acquiring IP/MAC network table  INT  information associated with the IP/MAC platform based on the NIT information  creating a network_list that identifies all networks_referred to by all stream_location_descriptors associated with the selected IP/MAC platform based on the INT information  and acquiring_network_information for all the networks in the network_list. In an aspect  an apparatus includes means for identifying an IP/MAC platform  means for acquiring NIT information  and means for acquiring INT information  means for creating a network_list that identifies_networks associated with the selected IP/MAC platform  and means for acquiring_network_information for all the networks in the network_list.
