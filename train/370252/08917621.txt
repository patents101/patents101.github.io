A method for obtaining_feedback_delay includes  obtaining a target_time_elapsed in a process from when a remote_radio_end_receives_uplink_data sent from a user_end to when the remote_radio_end_sends out feedback_information_responsive to the uplink_data to the user_end  wherein the feedback_information_responsive to the uplink_data is fed_back by a processing_node to the remote_radio_end__calculating a feedback_delay by adding the target_time and an air_interface_transmission_propagation_delay  wherein the air_interface_transmission_propagation_delay is a transmission_time of the uplink_data from the user_end to the remote_radio_end  and configuring  by the processing_node  an uplink hybrid automatic repeat request  HARQ  ACK/NACK feedback interval to be the feedback_delay.
