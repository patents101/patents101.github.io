Disclosed are method and apparatus for characterizing the temporal_loss_characteristics of a packet_data_network by multicast-based_inference. Multicast probes are transmitted from a source_node to a plurality of receiver_nodes  which record the arrivals of the multicast_probes. From the aggregate_data_comprising_recorded_arrivals of the end-to-end_paths from the source_node to each receiver_node__temporal_loss_characteristics of individual_links within the network may be calculated. In a network with a tree_topology  the complexity of calculations may be reduced through a process of subtree_partitioning.
