During communication by a mobile_device  when a communication_feasibility_determining_unit of an SGSN determines  based on a remaining_communication_volume  that the communication by the mobile_device cannot be continued  an access point information extracting unit extracts APN information regarding an APN with an unused_remaining_communication_volume and reports the extracted APN information to the mobile_device. An access_point_information_acquiring_unit of the mobile_device acquires APN information regarding the APN with an unused_remaining_communication_volume. When communication is next initiated  the APN information regarding the APN with an unused_remaining_communication_volume is transmitted to the SGSN to perform_communication.
