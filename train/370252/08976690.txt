The various embodiments of the present_invention_relate_generally to femto-relay_systems and methods. An exemplary_embodiment of the present_invention provides a femto-relay_system_comprising a relay-radio  a femto-radio  a joint_femto-relay_resource_management_module  and an IP-backhaul QoS monitoring module. The relay-radio is in communication with a macro-cell_base-station. The femto-radio is in communication with the relay-radio and configured to route_signals between a core_network and at least one femto-cell_user_equipment through an IP-backhaul link. The joint_femto-relay_resource_management_module is configured to intelligently_manage_radio_resources between the femto-radio and the relay-radio to reduce_cross-tier_interference. The IP-backhaul QoS monitoring module is configured to monitor a QoS being delivered by the IP-backhaul link and notify the relay-radio to route_signals between the femto-cell_user_equipment and core_network through the macro-cell_base-station if the QoS fall below a predetermined_threshold.
