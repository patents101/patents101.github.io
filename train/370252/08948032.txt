In general  techniques are described for measuring service-specific packet data unit  PDU  loss for individual_pseudowires that interconnect two or more L2 customer networks in a L2 virtual private network  L2VPN  such as a VPLS instance. In one example of the techniques  for every pseudowire of a VPLS instance pseudowire mesh  a pseudowire_label_policer at each of the pseudowire_endpoints_maintains_respective_counters for the number of PDUs transmitted and received at the endpoint. The pseudowire_label_policer may identify service-specific PDUs transmitted and received over individual_pseudowires of the VPLS instance by mapping_pseudowire_labels for the PDUs to the VPLS instance.
