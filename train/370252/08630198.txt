One embodiment_relates to an integrated_circuit_configured to perform_dynamic_transmit_equalization of a bi-directional_lane. The integrated_circuit_including an interface between the physical_coding and media_access_control_circuitry  and an equalization_control_circuit which is external to the physical_coding_circuitry and which is configured to perform the dynamic_transmit_equalization using said interface. Another embodiment_relates to a transceiver_circuit which includes physical_coding_circuitry and media_access_control_circuitry. The transceiver_circuit further includes an interface between the physical_coding_circuitry and the media_access_control_circuitry and an equalization_controller which is external to the physical_coding_circuitry and which is configured to perform_dynamic_transmit_equalization using said interface. The interface is configured to provide_transmit_coefficient_data in a time-multiplexed_signal_format from the media_access_control_circuitry to the physical_coding_circuitry. Other embodiments__aspects  and features are also disclosed.
