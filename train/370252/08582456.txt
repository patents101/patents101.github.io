A method and system for data_communication in a wireless_network is provided. A wireless_transmitter_transmits a locality_check_message from a wireless_transmitter to a wireless_receiver over a wireless_communication_medium. Upon receiving a locality_check_response_message from the wireless_receiver  the wireless_transmitter_marks the locality_check_response_message as valid even if it arrives after an original_locality_check_time_period since transmission of the locality_check_message  but before the end of an adjusted_locality_check_time_period. The adjusted_locality_check_time_period_comprises said original_locality_check_time_period_adjusted by delays in processing_layers at the transmitter and wireless_communication_medium_access_delays in data_communication between the wireless_transmitter and the wireless_receiver.
