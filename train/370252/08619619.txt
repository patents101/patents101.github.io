Provided is a communication_device  which is enabled to improve the throughput of a communication_system by reducing the difference of a transmission_power between an SCCH and an SDCH thereby to satisfy the required_quality of a PAPR. In this device  an MCS selection unit   111   of a transmission_unit___110___decides  with reference to a CQI lookup table  an MCS pattern  MCS 1   of the SDCH  an MCS pattern  MCS 2   of the SCCH and information__multiplex_information  on multiplex_positions on the time_axes of those two channels  on the basis of the CQI information. On the basis of the MCS 2  and the MCS 1   encoding modulation units   112  and  113___perform_encoding and modulating_operations. According to the multiplex_information  a channel_multiplexing_unit___114___time-division_multiplexes the SCCH and the SDCH thereby to generate a transmission_signal.
