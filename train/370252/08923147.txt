Methods and devices for processing and retransmitting_highway_communication_system_transmissions include determining a reliability of a received_message and including an indication of the reliability in retransmitted_transmissions. Reliability of received_messages may be based on a signal_strength of the received_peer_transmission__comparison of the signal_strength to a distance to the transmitter_based on message_contents  the age of the received_message  the signal_quality of the received_message  and other parameters. An indication of the determined_reliability may be included in retransmissions of the message to enable other vehicles and receiver_units in the highway_communication_system to benefit from the reliability_determination. Message reliability may be used as part of prioritizing_messages for processing. Messages may be processed according to priority so that high_priority_messages are processed before lower_priority_messages.
