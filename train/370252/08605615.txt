A method___500   and apparatus for multi-radio_coexistence has a victim user equipment  UE  that receives___515   a sequence of subframes at a first transceiver from a serving_base_station__measures___520___channel_state on the subframes to obtain_channel_state_measurements__determines___530   a high-low_interference_pattern_based on the channel_state_measurements  and transmits___550   to the serving_base_station a report that includes an indicator_related to the high-low_interference_pattern. The method can include the victim UE receiving   610   an aggressor reference waveform  ARW  from the second transceiver__determining___620___spatial_characteristics of the second transceiver from the ARW  and configuring___630   its antenna_system_based on the spatial_characteristics. The method can have the victim UE determining   640   second transceiver_characteristics from the ARW and transmitting___650___information regarding the second transceiver_characteristics to its serving_base_station.
