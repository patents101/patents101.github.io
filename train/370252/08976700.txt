A system that incorporates_teachings of the subject_disclosure may include  for example  a method for analyzing a wide_frequency_band with respect to signal_power_levels in specified narrow_frequency_bands__detecting_narrow_band_signal_power_levels_received in the specified narrow_frequency_bands__determining an average_composite_wideband_power_level from the narrow_band_signal_power_levels__determining an adaptive_threshold__detecting_narrow_band_interference according to one of the average_composite_wideband_power_level  the adaptive_threshold  or both  prioritizing the detected_narrow_band_interference  and selectively_filtering a portion of the detected_narrow_band_interference according to the prioritization. Other embodiments are disclosed.
