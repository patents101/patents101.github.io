A Secure Location Session Manager  SLSM  is an intelligent_router for open mobile alliance  OMA  Secure User Plane Location  SUPL  Version 1.0  and later  messages best implemented when multiple  geo-diverse SUPL servers are deployed in a distributed_environment  such as an active-active_redundant_configuration within a wireless_carrier s network. In a standalone_option  the SLSM acts as a    middleman    for all SUPL positioning messages between a mobile_device and a responsible SUPL server. In an embedded_option  the SLSM resides within an existing_server. The SLSM manages and stores_session_information for all pending and ongoing SUPL positioning sessions in internal_tables for routing and load_balancing_purposes. The external_interfaces of the SLSM consist of OMA ULP messages.
