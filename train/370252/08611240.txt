A wireless_network  such as an LTE     Long-Term Evolution     network  may be configured to monitor a communications_interface to set an inactivity_timer that  in turn__sets the operating_mode of a communications_interface. The operating_mode may comprise a time-domain_reception_pattern of the wireless_device. A wireless_device may monitor a communications_interface that includes at least a first logical_channel  for example for a first application  and a second logical_channel  for example for a second application . Based on monitoring the communications_interface  a first activity_state for the first logical_channel may be determined. Also  based on monitoring the communications_interface  a second activity_state  e.g.  an activity_status  for the second logical_channel may be determined. An inactivity_timer used by the communications_interface may be set to a first value or a second value based on the first and second activity_states. The battery_life of a wireless_device may be preserved by setting an inactivity_timer_responsive to the manner in which the wireless_device is being used.
