Techniques are provided for a radio_link_quality_monitoring_method and apparatus wherein a given user_equipment_device_receives a plurality of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex symbols that comprise a plurality of resource_elements_distributed in time and frequency  and which include reference_symbols. The objective of the radio_link_quality_monitoring is to predict the user_equipment_detection_probability of control_messages_transmitted by the base_station. The radio_link_quality_estimation_process_calculates two average_signal to noise_ratio_values over the complete_frequency_bandwidth for two assumed_control_channel_formats corresponding to in-sync and out-of-sync_conditions. The results of the calculations are then used to deduce the average_error_probabilities that are compared with predefined_thresholds to provide the in-sync/out-of-sync_indications.
