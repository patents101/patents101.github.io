A tone_relay_system_comprises a tone_detector_arranged to receive a sequence of signal_samples and to provide a plurality of media_descriptors  each media_descriptor_comprising a cell of one or more of the signal_samples and a tone_detection_meta-information for the cell  and a tone_relay_module_arranged to receive each media_descriptor  to perform an evaluation of the meta-information and modify the meta-information_depending on one or more preceding_media_descriptors when a result of the evaluation indicates an undetermined_tone_state  and to provide the media_descriptors with a predetermined_delay to a tone_aggregator_module  when the meta-information indicates a tone  for transmission over a network  and to provide the media_descriptors without the predetermined_time_delay to an encoder_module  for transmission over the network  otherwise.
