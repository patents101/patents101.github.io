Bias introduced by down-sampling may be eliminated  or significantly_reduced  by the present_embodiments. Methods and apparatuses are described for use in wireless communication systems including LTE and other mobile_data_systems. The method includes identifying a timing_offset_estimation_bias_caused by a misalignment between samples and a zero-offset_point of a preamble_signature.
