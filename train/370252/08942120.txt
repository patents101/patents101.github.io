Nodes in an ad_hoc_mobile_network are monitored to provide_secure_routing of packets. Malicious or selfish_behaviors by nodes are used to maintain and distribute_node_reputations. Based on the reputation  the most secure_route  which can have multiple_paths  is selected for packet_communications. In conjunction with secure_routing  a forward_error_correction_code is adaptively_optimized according to the reputation through every adjacent_nodes along the route to avoid_eavesdropping and falsification by malicious_nodes.
