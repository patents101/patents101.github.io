The invention_relates to a method for determining a quality of service  QoS . A received signal strength indicator  RSSI  value associated with a downlink_signal  a gain of a downlink_power_amplifier  and an increase in the RSSI value received by the mobile_device associated with the downlink_signal are determined. The QoS based on at least one of the RSSI value  the gain  and the increase in RSSI value received by the mobile_device is determined and displayed to the user.
