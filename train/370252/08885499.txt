Methods of operating_devices on a wireless_network as access points  AP  or spectrum monitors  SM . An adaptive radio management  ARM  process operating on the digital_network_senses_network_conditions_based on data from APs and SMs on the network  and in response to conditions changes devices from AP operation to SM operation  and from SM operation back to AP operation. A method for providing wideband_spectrum_analysis_functions on a radio_operating as an AP on a channel_proving_client_connectivity_services. A method for scanning_off-channel for shorter_durations between transmissions to collect_spectral_data and a method for explicitly quieting IEEE 802.11_transmissions on a channel to collect_spectral_data.
