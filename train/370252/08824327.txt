A system for exchanging_information for improved_call_quality includes an exchange_engine for switching between networks or communication_channels and a monitoring_module for determining_quality of communication over a network or communication_channels and initiating_switching in response to poor_call_quality. The monitoring_module may be responsive to input from the user or to call_quality as determined for example by statistical_measurement. The exchange_engine_identifies the network or communication_channel in use for the current_call__determines the call_quality for a second network or communication_channel not being used for the current_call__determines whether call_quality of the second network is better than the first network  and switches the current_call between a first user and the second user from the first network to the second network if the call_quality of the second network is better than the first network.
