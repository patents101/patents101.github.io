A method of UE RSRQ measurement precaution for interference_coordination is provided. The UE receives radio signals of a neighbor_cell under measurement. The neighbor_cell_applies a TDM silencing pattern for inter-cell interference_coordination  TDM ICIC . The UE determines a measurement_pattern that includes multiple_subframes. The UE performs RSRQ measurements of the cell over multiple_subframes and obtains multiple RSRQ measurement samples. The UE derives RSRQ measurement result by estimating the multiple RSRQ samples and applying a weighted_average. RSRQ samples estimated to be more applicable are taken into account to more extent  e.g.  applied with more weight  and/or RSRQ samples estimated to be less applicable are taken into account to less extent  e.g.  applied with less weight  or discarded with zero weight . With UE precaution  a more predictable RSRQ measurement result is produced.
