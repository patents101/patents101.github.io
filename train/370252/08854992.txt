A method  a system and a base-station for automatically_determining_delays of data_transmitted via Transmission Control Protocol  TCP  and inflating these delays in order to reduce_jitter and improve TCP throughput in a communications_network. A Dynamic Jitter Reduction  DJR  logic/utility operating within a communications_node_measures_delays on a rolling_basis in order to capture the delay_profile. Based on the delay_profile  the DJR utility determines a delay_target. The DJR utility    inflates   /augments future/expected delays toward the delay_target by performing on one or more of the following   a  using a delay_based_factor in the scheduler_metric for TCP applications   b  performing_fine-tuning of link_adaptation_schemes   c  delaying_transmission of packets at the transmit or receive_buffer  and  d  delaying_transmission of a received TCP ACK signal from the media access control  MAC  sub-layer to TCP layer.
