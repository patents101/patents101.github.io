A measuring_device for determining the channel-quality_feedback_quality of mobile_stations contains a base_station  a mobile_station and a measuring_unit. The measuring_unit contains at least two antennas and a processing_device. The measuring_unit and the mobile_station_receive_signals in each case by means of at least two antennas from the same at least two antennas of the base_station. The mobile_station_determines a channel-quality_feedback value from the signals it has received. The processing_device_determines the orthogonality of the signals_received by the measuring_unit. The processing_device_determines a channel-quality_feedback value from the orthogonality. From this and from the channel-quality_feedback value of the mobile_station  the processing_device_determines the quality of the latter.
