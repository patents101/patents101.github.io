A method is provided to determine_optimal_data_rate and packet_length in mobile_networks. The method_directly_determines the optimal_packet_length  L  and data_rate  D  which allows fast_convergence in the mobile_channel. The method_automatically_identifies and quantifies_channel_conditions  as well as adjusts_parameters according to changes of channel_conditions. A variable  Channel condition Index  CCI  is abstracted from simulations and then used to describe and quantify the impact of three components of channel_conditions  signal-to-noise ratio  SNR  multipath environment and velocity. Based on packet completion rate  PCR  status  the channel_condition is identified in terms of CCI value. Once CCI is identified  the model of effective_throughput G is directly_optimized to locate the best packet_length  L  and data_rate  D .
