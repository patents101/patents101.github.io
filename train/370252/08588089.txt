A mechanism for controlling_resources and/or settings of an access_network_element like a base_station is provided which allows an autonomous_reconfiguration of  for example  the antenna_configuration_based on a set of performance_indicators in a base_station. The base_station can reconfigure itself without the need of operator_control so that during periods with low_capacity_demands the base_station will reconfigure_correspondingly  which may include a reduction of active_cells by turning off the power for a part of the installed_equipment.
