A device in a wireless_network_receives_signals and determines media access control  MAC  slot boundaries of the received_signals. The MAC slot boundaries are averaged in time  and a local_slot_boundary is modified in response_thereto. The local MAC slot boundary is modified by less than ten_percent of a short_interframe_space until the local MAC slot boundary is within one orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  OFDM  cyclic prefix duration of the averaged MAC slot boundaries.
