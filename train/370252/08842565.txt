A method and apparatus is provided for assigning_resources for an acknowledgement_channel  such as the PHICH in LTE systems. A list of acknowledgement_channels for a group of scheduled_mobile_terminals is generated. The list is sorted in descended_order of the required_transmit_energies for the corresponding mobile_terminals. The acknowledgement_channels are then assigned to channel_groups one at a time in sorted_order to an available channel_group with the lowest_cumulative_transmit_energy. By sorting the channel_list before assigning_resources  the variance in the transmit_energies for different channel_groups is reduced. Given enough number of acknowledgement_channel_groups  the small_variance in the transmit_energies for different channel_groups_implies_improved_error_rate_performance.
