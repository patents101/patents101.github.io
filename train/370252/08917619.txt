Method and apparatus for controlling in-device coexistence  IDC  interference in a wireless_communication_system are described in the present_invention. The present_invention includes transmitting UE capability information whether the UE has a capability to measure IDC  to a base station  BS  receiving measurement configuration information whether the UE is allowed to send IDC indication  from the BS  and transmitting the IDC indication and at least one of measurements which are a measurement in consideration of IDC and a measurement without consideration of IDC to the BS. It is possible to control_reducing_occurrence of in-device_coexistence_interference.
