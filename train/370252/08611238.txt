Disclosed is multiplexing_transmissions of Uplink Control Information  UCI  signals having variable_payloads from User Equipments  UEs . The UCI transmission uses a first format_type if its size is less than or equal to a predetermined_values and it uses a second format_type if its size is greater than a predetermined value. When the first format_type is used the UE multiplexing is through a first method while when the second format_type is used the UE multiplexing is through a second method which is different than the first method. The structure of the second format_type is the same as the structure used for the transmission of data_information by UEs. The UEs can also be grouped and UCI transmission can be triggered through the reception of control_signaling_addressing a group of UEs and indicating UCI transmission by a sub-group of UEs in the group of UEs.
