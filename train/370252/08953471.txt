An approach is provided to detect a spam_message_transmitted over a packetized__network-based_telephony_system. A request to initiate a first voice_communication_session is received from a requestor. A voice_communications_session is established with the requestor over the computer_network. An audible_ringing_tone is sent to the requestor over the established_voice_communications_session. While the audible_ringing_tone is being sent  audio_data that is received from the requestor is analyzed. If the analysis_detects an audible_message in the audio_data  then the requestor is identified as a possible spam_source. On the other hand  if the analysis_fails to detect the audible_message in the audio_data then the established_voice_communications_session is handled as a non-spam_event.
