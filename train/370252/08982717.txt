An apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention  the apparatus for detecting_transmission_power of a first communication_scheme in a mobile_communication_terminal having a first modem for the first communication_scheme and a second modem for a second communication_scheme which is different from the first communication_scheme  includes  a feedback_circuit_configured to detect a high_frequency_signal_outputted from a power_amplifier of the first communication_scheme and convert the detected_high_frequency_signal into an analog_signal  a reception_unit_configured to receive the analog_signal_outputted from the feedback_circuit and band_information_transmitted from the first modem for the first communication_scheme  and an output_unit_configured to output a particular value after comparing a signal_outputted from the reception_unit and a predetermined_signal.
