A bandwidth_variable_communication_method is provided that enables_effective use of frequency_bandwidths in which the bit_rate is constant in every optical_path. The bandwidth_variable_communication_method includes  when a network_management_apparatus_sets or changes an optical_path that passes through plural_communication_apparatuses__measuring or obtaining an optical_signal_quality_deterioration_amount in a route of the optical_path__selecting a modulation_format in which a spectrum_bandwidth is the narrowest from among modulation_formats by which transmission is available on conditions of the optical_signal_quality_deterioration_amount and a desired_bit_rate B  bit/s  and exchanging_control_information between the network_management_apparatus and a control_unit of each communication_apparatus on the optical_path_route. A bandwidth_variable_communication_apparatus_receives the control_information  and changes a passband_based on the received_control_information.
