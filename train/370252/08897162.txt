The present_invention_discloses a method for channel_measurement which includes  determining the size of measured_bandwidth of a terminal and the location of the measured_bandwidth in system_bandwidth__determining the size of a measured_sub-band and/or the quantity or sizes of measured_sub-band_sets according to the measured_bandwidth__sending the determined_size of the measured_bandwidth and the location of the measured_bandwidth in the system_bandwidth  and the size of the measured_sub-band and/or the quantity or sizes of the measured_sub-band_sets to the terminal__receiving_measurement_results_returned by the terminal. With the method_provided in the present_invention__invalid_feedback is prevented and effectiveness and accuracy of channel_measurement and feedback are improved.
