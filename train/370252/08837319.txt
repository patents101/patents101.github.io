The invention provides a system that implements an algorithm for integrated_link_adaptation and power_control to achieve specified error_rates and to improve an overall throughput for real-time_applications in wireless_packet_networks. The system_initially_divides_wireless_terminals into groups according to their signal_path_gains. Afterwards  the system can periodically_adapt_transmissions  i.e.  link_adaptations__based on the required_error_rates__actual_error_statistics and average_transmission_power for each wireless_terminal_group. Furthermore  transmission_power can be adjusted by an enhanced Kalman-filter method to ensure_successful_reception.
