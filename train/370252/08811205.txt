The invention_relates to a wireless_mobile_communication_system___400   such as a mobile_telephone_network. Network configuration data may contain inaccuracies  such as an error in the location of a base_station___432__434  . These inaccuracies may lead to errors in estimating the location of a mobile_communication_unit___410  . The invention_creates_probability_density_functions for the location of a mobile_communication_unit__based on communications with the mobile_communication_network___430  . A confidence_score may be calculated for each probability_density_function. A combined_function can then be derived from the individual_confidence_scores. Maximization of the combined_function may then lead to a corrected value for a network_parameter of the network_configuration_data. Corrected network_configuration_data leads to more accurate_measurements of the location of mobile_communication_units. In addition__upgrades to the antennae and base_stations can be planned more effectively.
