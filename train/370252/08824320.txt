While directional_communication using millimeter_waves is realized  the number of communication_stations through which simultaneous_communication is possible is increased to increase the throughput of the entire_system. Beamforming of a transmission_beam is performed not only on a data_frame  but also on a CTS frame. In a case where the transmission/reception_beam of a hidden terminal  STA C  is in a direction different from that of a data transmission side  STA A  with respect to a data receiving side  STA B  the hidden terminal  STA C  ceases to receive a CTS. Consequently  a transmission_stop_period is not set  and a communication_operation with a communication party terminal  STA D  thereof can be continued.
