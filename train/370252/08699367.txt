Transmission monitoring can be used to determine the optimum_data_rate for a channel. The transmission_monitoring can include sending_data_packets in the channel using various data_rates. At least some data_packets are sent using the current_optimum_data_rate  a rate_lower than the current_optimum_data_rate  and a rate_higher than the current_optimum_data_rate. One of these data_rates can be selected as the new optimum_data_rate. In one embodiment  if the current_optimum_data_rate is less than a predetermined_data_rate  then the client is triggered to begin_scanning for other available access_points.
