Provided are a method and apparatus in which user_equipment_performs_random_access_procedures in a wireless_communication_system. More particularly  an embodiment is provided in which a first type_backoff_parameter and a second type_backoff_parameter are provided from a base_station. The backoff_parameter is transmitted from the base_station before the user_equipment_transmits a first random_access_preamble to the base_station. The first type_backoff_parameter and the second type_backoff_parameter are included in a random_access_response.
