In a method and a device for requesting Channel Quality Indication  CQI  reports from a mobile_station of a cellular_radio_system  the CQI reports are requested in response to a measured Block Error Rate  BLER  of transmissions from the mobile_station. In accordance with one embodiment of the present_invention a CQI report is requested if the BLER of the mobile_station is above a predetermined_threshold value C. The threshold value C can be set to a value related to the BLER target. In particular the value C can be set to the same value or as a value close the BLER that is targeted to try to adapt the CQI report request to how well the base_station knows the channel. It can also be set_higher or lower to also consider how much CQI reporting the base_station_estimates can be afforded when it comes to uplink_resources and uplink_grant_signaling in the downlink.
