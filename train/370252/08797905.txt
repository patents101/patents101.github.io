Lawful interception  LI  is supported on a flat_mobile_data_network with breakout_services at the basestation. A first service_mechanism at the basestation is prevented from breaking out services for subscribers that are part of LI. A second service_mechanism in the core_network_maintains a subscriber_list of subscribers that are subject to LI. In response to a PDP context activation by a subscriber on the list  the second service_mechanism does not supply PDP context information to the first service_mechanism for data_breakout thus preventing_breakout for the subscriber_subject to lawful_interception.
