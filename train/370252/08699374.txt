The present_invention_discloses a channel_estimation_method for an orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing_system with cyclic-delay_diversity. The method_makes_pilots have the same amplitude and equally_partitions the pilots into a number of pilot_groups. In addition  the method_equally_spaces the pilots of each group in a frequency_domain and determines the pilot_locations and cyclic-delay_coefficient of each pilot_group in order to optimize the channel_estimation of a receiver. The method can perform the channel_estimation by using just one OFDM symbol.
