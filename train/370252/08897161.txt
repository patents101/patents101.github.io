To reduce an uplink_interference in a network with a first base_station of a large_output and a second base_station of a small_output. Detecting the interference  the second base_station_urges the first base_station to hand over a terminal_causing it to the second base_station. Multiple base_stations and one or more terminals_exist in this system  each terminal_connects with one base_station  and a serving_base_station is changed according to a communication_state of each terminal. If the different second base_station other than the first base_station to which the terminal_connects_detects a large_interference  the second base_station will multicast_transmit_information for urging_handover to the base_stations except itself. The base_station having received the information_specifies a terminal_giving the interference to the second base_station  and makes it to be handed over thereto.
