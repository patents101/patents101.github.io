A method for managing_transmission_settings in a wireless_point-to-point_link__including_making a first estimate of a current_required_traffic_capacity for transmitting in a first direction  from a first point in the wireless_point-to-point_link to a second point  and selecting a first technique for transmitting in the first direction__based  at least in part  on the first estimate of the current_required_traffic_capacity  in which the first technique_selected provides a traffic_capacity which is less than a maximum_capacity possible in the first direction. Related apparatus and methods are also described.
