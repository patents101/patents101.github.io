A computer-implemented_method and apparatus_verifies_integrity of a Voice over Internet Protocol  VoIP  virtual connection at an analog terminal adapter  ATA  at an edge of an Internet Protocol  IP  network. A VoIP transaction is initiated toward a cooperating_test_unit across the IP network  establishing a VoIP virtual_circuit. The test_unit_responds by transmitting a digital_representation of or information_representing a test_tone across the IP network to the ATA. By evaluating the test_tone at the ATA  integrity of a bearer_channel of the virtual_circuit can be verified_directly  and integrity of a signaling_channel of the virtual_circuit can be verified_indirectly.
