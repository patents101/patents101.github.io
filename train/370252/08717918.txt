A network_device_transmits and receives_data_packets between the network_device and a network. The data_packets includes information about a procedure_needed in order to process the data_packets. According to the information  the network_device_executes the procedure to process the data_packets. If the time of the procedure has not been executed to process the data_packets is more than a predetermined_time and no other data_packets are needed to be processed  the network_device_turns off the procedure_automatically.
