An ad-hoc_network that includes a plurality of telephones at least one of which is a mobile_repeater_telephone for establishing a first telephone_connection_line between a first caller_telephone and a first receiver_telephone  and for simultaneously_establishing at least one second telephone_connection_line between a second caller_telephone and a second receiver_telephone. A subset of all the mobile_repeater_telephones in the network each have its own unique_code and a subset of the unique_codes are known to a subset of all mobile_repeater_telephones in the ad-hoc_network. The mobile_repeater_telephones have a software_program_stored on the processors of the telephones or a database that is accessible by the telephones. The software_program includes a geographic_map in electronic_form of the area of the network and includes data about topography and obstacles and how much the obstacles_attenuate the signal.
