In one embodiment  a router_selects a particular peer from an original_update_group used with an Exterior Gateway Protocol  EGP  such as Border Gateway Protocol  BGP . The original_update_group includes a plurality of peers of the router that share a same outbound_policy and that receive_common_update_messages  from the router  of routing_table_information. The router_determines that the particular peer is a potential_slow_peer_based on a first type of indicia  wherein a slow_peer is a peer that cannot keep up with a rate at which the router_generates_update_messages over a prolonged_period of time. The router_confirms that one or more second types of indicia are consistent with the particular peer being a slow_peer. In response to the confirmation  the router_determines that the particular peer is a slow_peer.
