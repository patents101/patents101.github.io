Systems and methods for the adaptive_monitoring of telecommunications_networks are described. In some embodiments  a method may include monitoring_traffic_transmitted through a mobile_telecommunications_network  e.g.  3G  4G  LTE  etc.  and identifying a monitoring_rule. The monitoring_rule may associate a selected_portion of the traffic  e.g.  based on content_type__source__destination__transport_protocol__session  etc.  with a monitoring_sampling_ratio  and the monitoring_sampling_ratio may determine a fraction of the selected_portion of the traffic_usable to provide one or more performance_indicators  e.g.  service_indicators__network_congestion__connection_maintenance__service_quality  and/or network_availability . The method may further include modifying the monitoring_sampling_ratio in response to a change in network_monitoring_conditions  e.g.  one or more probes_operating at or near capacity__scheduled_maintenance_events__peak_traffic_times  etc.
