Aspects of the present_disclosure are directed towards a data_retrieving_engine that is designed to retrieve_interval_data from the endpoint_devices that is communicated for indicating_utility_usage_readings. The interval_data is provided at least once for each interval_period  used by each of the endpoint_devices . The data_retrieving_engine is additionally_designed for retrieving  from the endpoint_devices  other different type of data  which is transmitted over a time_period that overlaps_multiple_interval_periods. In certain implementations  the system allows a dynamic_adjustment to a ratio of the respective_amounts for each type of data.
