A method and apparatus for managing a virtual_private_network are disclosed. For example  the method_collects_performance_data for at least one parameter from a plurality of customer_edge_routers and a plurality of provider_edge_routers associated with the virtual_private_network. The method_correlates the performance_data for identifying one or more performance_exceptions_based on a threshold for each of the at least one parameter  and performs a trending_analysis using the one or more performance_exceptions to predict a potential_problem that will impact the virtual_private_network.
