Communication in a dominant_interference_scenario may be supported by performing inter-cell interference coordination  ICIC . Resource coordination/partitioning may be performed to allocate_resources to a serving Node B located near the vicinity of a strong interfering Node B. The interfering Node B may avoid_transmitting on the allocated/protected_resources__possibly except for a common reference signal  CRS . A UE can then communicate with the serving Node B on the protected_resources in the presence of the interfering Node B and may observe no interference__possibly except for the CRS  from the interfering Node B. When CRS tones of an interferer may collide with control/data_tones of a serving cell  CRS interference cancellation  CRS IC  or puncturing of interfered resource elements  REs  may be appropriate. Certain aspects of the present_disclosure_provide_techniques  where the UE may dynamically_switch between CRS IC and RE puncturing_based on certain parameters.
