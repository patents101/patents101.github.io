Providing for record_filtering in distributed_dynamic_clustering_algorithms for coordinated multipoint  CoMP  wireless communication is described herein. By way of example  strategy_selection_records_distributed as part of a belief_propagation_network are pruned at recipient_nodes  thereby reducing_processing_overhead for dynamic_clustering. As a result__cooperative_policies can be determined with greater_efficiency  and with greater_relevance to local_clusters of cooperating_base_stations. In some aspects__record_pruning can comprise_identifying and discarding_redundant or incompatible_sets of policy_decisions. In at least one aspect  a number of evaluated_records can be capped_based on relevance  while preserving_deployment-wide_applicability of the belief_propagation_network. Accordingly  dynamic distributed CoMP decisions are optimized on a deployment-wide_scale that more efficiently_converges to maximum_utility_solutions.
