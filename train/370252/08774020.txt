A device for a method for determining the transmission_performance of sub-channels of a transmission_channel in a radio-communication_system is specified  where data-comprising_signal_carriers are generated for the setup of the transmission_channel within the radio-communication_system and accommodated in the sub-channels of the transmission_channel  and the transmission_performance of the sub-channels is determined on the basis of the signal_sub-carriers_superposed with interferers. In this context  each sub-channel_occupies a separate_bandwidth_sub-range of a total_bandwidth_range of the transmission_channel. The bandwidth_sub-range is disposed within the bandwidth at a spacing_distance from other bandwidth_sub-ranges of the total_bandwidth_range  and the interferers are limited to the bandwidth_sub-range_allocated to the respective_sub-channel.
