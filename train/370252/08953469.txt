A communication_device_capable of connecting to a network includes a switching_portion that switches an operation_state of the communication_device to one of a measurement_state and a non-measurement_state within a predetermined_cycle  the measurement_state being a state in which an available bandwidth is measured  the non-measurement_state being a state in which the available bandwidth is not measured  and the available bandwidth being a bandwidth available in the network  a first transmission_portion that transmits to a partner_device a plurality of measurement_packets while sequentially_changing_transmission_intervals  in a state in which the operation_state has been switched to the measurement_state and a second transmission_portion that transmits a data_packet to the partner_device  using a bandwidth_smaller than the available bandwidth  in a state in which the operation_state has been switched to the non-measurement_state.
