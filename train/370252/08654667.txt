A demodulating_method and a demodulating_apparatus at a receiver_based on a downlink_transmit_diversity_mode in a LTE system are provided by the present_invention. The method includes  dividing_received_data from sub-carriers of each receiving_antenna_based on a transmit_diversity_mode into multiple_groups of received_data according to numbers of antennas of a transmitter and a receiver__performing an independent_demodulation on each group of the multiple_groups of received_data_separately according to a demodulation_algorithm of two-port_transmitting and single-port_receiving  so as to obtain a corresponding group of demodulated_data  and for multiple_groups of demodulated_data corresponding to same transmitted_data__performing a maximum_ratio_combination on the multiple_groups of demodulated_data according to a channel_condition corresponding to each group of the multiple_groups of demodulated_data  so as to obtain a corresponding final_demodulated_data value. The demodulating_method and the demodulating_apparatus of the present_invention can ensure the performance of the system_adopting the diversity_algorithm in situations of various kinds of antenna_configurations__reduce_cost and the complexity of devices in a practical_application  and is very easy for project_implementation.
