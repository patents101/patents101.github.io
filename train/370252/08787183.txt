Techniques for using multiple description codes  MDC  for channel_feedback to improve_channel_estimation_accuracy are described. A receiver may obtain an initial/measured_channel_vector for a communication_channel. The receiver may select a codebook in a set of codebooks for quantizing the initial_channel_vector. Each codebook may include a different set of channel_vectors/codewords. Different codebooks may be selected in different reporting_intervals. The receiver may select a channel_vector in the selected_codebook  and the selected_channel_vector may have  i  a largest_correlation with a normalized_channel_vector or  ii  a smallest_distance to the initial_channel_vector. The receiver may send the selected_channel_vector and possibly the selected_codebook to a transmitter. The transmitter may receive the selected/reported_channel_vectors from the receiver in different reporting_intervals and may derive a final_channel_vector for the communication_channel_based on the reported_channel_vectors.
