Methods and apparatus for providing layered_gear_mechanism to analyze_network_loss and latency_conditions includes bundling_data into data_packets of varying_depths  at a source with data_packets of each depth_belonging to a particular data_type. The data_packets of varying_depths are transmitted in layers over a network  to a destination. Information for the transmitted_data_packets for each layer is collected_constantly and analyzed as the data_progresses along the network to identify corresponding network_transmission_characteristics. The transmission of subsequent_data_packets for anyone of the layers is adjusted_based on the network_transmission_characteristics. The adjusting is repeated one or more times_based on the analyzed_information for the transmitted_data_packets. The transition_metrics for each layer is utilized for relative_analysis of transmission_metrics across the layers to set the adjusting.
