An evolved Node B  eNB  and method for coherent_coordinated_multipoint_transmission with per CSI-RS feedback are generally described herein. The eNB may configure a first cooperating_point and a second cooperating_point to jointly_transmit a multi-node channel-state information  CSI  reference signal  RS   CSI-RS  in predetermined_resource_elements of a resource_block. The eNB may receive CSI reports as feedback from user equipment  UE . The CSI reports may include a precoding matrix indicator  PMI  indicating relative_phase_information between the cooperating_points_based on the multi-node CSI-RS. The CSI reports for the multi-node CSI-RS may be restricted to a PMI of rank-1. The eNB may configure the cooperating_points for a coherent_joint_transmission to the UE based at least on the relative_phase_information. The coherent_joint_transmission may also be jointly_beamformed_based on single-node PMIs.
