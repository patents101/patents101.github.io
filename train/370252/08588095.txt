A data_conversion_device includes a receiving_unit that receives first data and second data__transmitting after a start of the first data__transmitted from the first device to the second device  a transmitting_unit that transmits the received first data and second data to a third device  and a control_unit that controls a time_point of transmitting the second data from the transmitting_unit to lengthen a time_interval between transmission of the first data and second data from the transmitting_unit than a first time_interval between transmission of the first data from the transmitting_unit and reception of response_data to the first data by the receiving_unit when the first time_interval is longer than a time_interval between the transmission of the first data and second data from the first device to the second device.
