A method and a device for reconfiguring_communication_transmission_characteristics in response to a changing_communication_environment is provided. An environment at a communication_device is characterized to determine if a transmission_parameter associated with processing of a communication_signal at a physical_layer or a network_interface_layer should change_based on current_conditions at the communication_device. If a need is identified  a second transmission_parameter is selected_based on the environment_monitoring. A request_identifying the second transmission_parameter is sent to a second communication_device using an existing_communication_link. A response from the second communication_device is received_indicating_acceptance or rejection of use of the second transmission_parameter. If the response indicates acceptance of use of the second transmission_parameter  the physical_layer and/or the network_interface_layer are reconfigured_based on the selected second transmission_parameter.
