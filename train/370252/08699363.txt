The present_invention_relates to a method and an arrangement for the power_management of a digital_communication_line such as a digital_subscriber_line DSL. A problem_addressed by the invention is that the transitioning of the digital_subscriber_line from a low_transmission_power_state to a high_transmission_power_state can cause disturbance to adjacent_lines. This problem is solved by the current_invention by an access_node AN that is arranged to step-wise_increase the power_state until the high_transmission_power_state has been reached. The invention also comprises_embodiments of monitoring and detecting_traffic_events that serve as triggers of the transitioning.
