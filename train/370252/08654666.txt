Disclosed is a communication_method in a multi-carrier_system__including__allocating_radio_resources for transmitting_signals to a middle_guard_band  and transmitting the signals through the radio_resources  wherein the middle_guard_band is a frequency_band_positioned between used bands of a plurality of carriers  respectively  within an aggregated_carrier_formed by aggregating the plurality of carriers and a unit_allocating the radio_resources of the middle_guard_band is different from a unit_allocating the radio_resources of the used bands. A multi-carrier_system uses the guard_bands between the carriers to improve_channel_estimation_performance or increase_efficiency of radio_resources.
