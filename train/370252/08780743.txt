A method for organizing an architecture of access_points in a distributed_wireless_network includes measuring_interference between the access_points__assigning_radiofrequency_channels to the access_points_based on the measured_interference and creating_distributed_antenna_groups of multiple_access_points_operating on a same radio_frequency_channel. A distributed_wireless_network includes a plurality of access_points and a central_controller_connected to the access_points via a common_backbone  the central_controller being configured to assign_radio_frequency_channels to the access_points according to the method.
