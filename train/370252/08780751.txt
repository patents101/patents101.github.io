When a determining_unit___110___determines__based on the number of resource_blocks in the entire_system_band and the number of resource_blocks per subband  that a subband_formed of a lower_number of resource_blocks than the number of resource_blocks per subband is present  a channel_capacity_calculator___140   using a combined_noise_power which a noise_power_calculator___120___calculates_based on reference_signals_included in the small_subband and the adjacent_subband and a combined_signal_power which a signal_power_calculator___130___calculates_based on reference_signals_included in the small_subband and the adjacent_subband and the combined_noise_power  and a CQI transmitter   150   transmits the result to a radio_base_station.
