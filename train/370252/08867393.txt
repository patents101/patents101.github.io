There are provided a method and apparatus for allocating a sounding_channel in a wireless_communication_system. A base_station_transmits a first sounding_channel_allocation_data to allocate a first sounding_channel for a first system to a first zone  and transmits a second sounding_channel_allocation_data to allocate a second sounding_channel for a second system other than the first system to a second zone. The first zone and the second zone are multiplexed by an FDM  Frequency Division Multiplexing  method  and the first sounding_channel and the second sounding_channel are allocated to a same OFDMA  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access  symbol. A channel_response can be estimated_accurately when a terminal for IEEE  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  802.16m_system and a terminal for IEEE 802.16e_system_coexist in a legacy_support_mode.
