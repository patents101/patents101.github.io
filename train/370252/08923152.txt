A method is disclosed for sampling_data_elements from a data_stream that comprises a plurality of data_elements  each data_element having a respective_unique_quasi-random_identifier_determined from a set of identifiers. Data elements are selected from the data_stream whose identifiers are within a first element_selection_range to obtain a set_including a predefined_number of selected_data_elements  the first element_selection_range being a subset of the set of identifiers. A second element_selection_range is determined as a proper_subset of the first element_selection_range. Data elements are discarded from the set of selected_data_elements whose identifiers are not within the second element_selection_range. At least one further data_element is selected from the data_stream whose identifier is within the second element_selection_range for the set of selected_data_elements.
