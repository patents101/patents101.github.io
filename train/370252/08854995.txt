A method and Mobile Subscriber Station  MSS  are provided for transmitting Channel Quality Information  CQI  in a wireless_communication_system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access  OFDMA  scheme. A Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratio  CINR  of at least two bands are measured  each of the at least two bands_including a plurality of adjacent_subcarriers for a band Adaptive Modulation and Coding  AMC  operation. A Report Response  REP-RSP  message including first information_related to the measured CINR is sent. Second information_related to a differential CINR of the at least two bands is sent via a Channel Quality Information Channel  CQICH .
