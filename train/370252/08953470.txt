A system and method for facilitating_connecting a switch to a network to improve_network_performance. In an illustrative_embodiment  the system includes a first module for determining when the switch is initially_connected to a network and providing a signal in response_thereto. A second module_selectively_forms_adjacencies with peers of the switch in response to the signal and based on one or more predetermined_parameters. In a more specific_embodiment  the switch is a router or Layer-3  L3  switch. The one or more predetermined_parameters include a load_factor__values_pertaining to capabilities of a processor_included in the router__bandwidth_capabilities of the interface and/or the router__internal_router_queue_counts  and so on. The router_employs a routing_protocol such as Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol  EIGRP . The second module_throttles and adjacency-formation_rate_based on the predetermined_parameters.
