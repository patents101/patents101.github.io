A node having a multiple_protocol_receiver may listen to multiple_links in parallel and determine a quality of links having multiple_communication_technologies between the node and multiple_neighbor_nodes. The multiple_communication_technologies may include radio frequency  RF  communication technologies and one or more power line communication  PLC  communication technologies. The node_determines a link_quality_metric for each link associated with an optimum_communication_technology and data_rate  and maintains_availability_information of neighbor_nodes. The node may then route_communications to neighbor_nodes using the link_quality_metric and the availability_information.
