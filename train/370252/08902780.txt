Techniques are described for verifying the connectivity_status of multiple_paths through a computer_network. The techniques may be useful in testing the connectivity of label switched paths  LSPs  and particularly useful point-to-multipoint  P2MP  LSPs. In some embodiments  a P2MP label switched path  LSP  ping protocol may be used a first connectivity_verification_protocol for the P2MP LSP and a Multipoint Bidirectional Forwarding Detection  MP BFD  protocol may be used as a second connectivity_verification_protocol. In addition  use of the LSP ping protocol for connectivity_testing of the P2MP LSP may be used to boot-strap_session_information for MP BFD sessions with egress_devices of the P2MP LSP.
