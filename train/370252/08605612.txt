Provided are a method and an apparatus for extracting QoS parameters in a mobile_device. In the method  all packets_received from a terminal_device are monitored  and SIP packets are filtered. When a real-time_service_application is executed on the terminal_device  and an SIP request packet or an SIP response packet is filtered and input  QoS parameters are extracted from the SIP request packet or the SIP response packet. The extracted QoS parameters are incorporated into a wireless_link_data_resource_request and transmitted to a wireless_network_device. When a response to the wireless_link_data_resource_request is received  an uplink_filter value for a new resource is extracted and added to a packet_monitoring_list.
