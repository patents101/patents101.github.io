The present_invention_relates to a method in which user_equipment_transmits a non-periodic_sounding_reference_signal in a wireless_communication_system. In detail  the method_comprises  a step of receiving a downlink_control_channel from a base_station  a step of decoding a downlink control information  DCI  format contained in the downlink_control_channel  a step of checking a non-periodic_sounding_reference_signal_transmission_instruction in the DCI format  and a step of transmitting a non-periodic_sounding_reference_signal to the base_station in accordance with the transmission_instruction. Preferably  if the downlink_control_channel is received via an n
