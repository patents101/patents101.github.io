A method and apparatus for transmitting ACK/NACK  Acknowledgement/Negative-ACK  state information in a wireless_communication_system. The method includes receiving  by a user equipment  UE  multiple_transmission_blocks through multiple_downlink_component_carriers from a base station  BS  and transmitting  by the UE  multiple transmission block ACK/NACK state information through a single_uplink_component_carrier to the BS. The multiple transmission block ACK/NACK state information indicates a number of ACK responses among ACK/NACK responses corresponding to each of the multiple_transmission_blocks.
