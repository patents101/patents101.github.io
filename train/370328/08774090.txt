Methods and apparatuses are provided that facilitate_detaching one of a plurality of network_connections to ensure_state_information is retained at one or more network_nodes. For a device_initiated_detach  the device can transmit a handover_message_related to performing a handover of one network_connection to another active_network_connection  as opposed to explicitly_detaching the network_connection. This can cause at least some state_information  such as a gateway_identifier  to be retained in one or more network_nodes. For a network_initiated_detach  a gateway can provision_state_information to a state_information_server following receiving a routing_tunnel_termination_message to ensure_state_information_deleted as a part of the detach is re-provisioned to the state_information_server.
