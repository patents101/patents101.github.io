A wireless_communication_device_including a first transceiver  a second transceiver  and a coexistence_module. The first transceiver_transmits a first signal and operates according to a first wireless_communication_standard. The second transceiver_selects a first channel of multiple_channels and transmits a second signal on the first channel. The second transceiver_operates according to a second wireless_communication_standard. The first channel is associated with a frequency. The coexistence_module__based on the frequency of the first channel__alters a transmission_characteristic of the first signal to be transmitted by the first transceiver and alters a transmission_characteristic of the second signal to be transmitted by the second transceiver. The transmission_characteristic of the first signal and the transmission_characteristic of the second signal  as altered by the coexistence_module__prevent_interference with the first signal and the second signal.
