A method of operating a mobile_wireless_network is described to ensure_proper_function of protocol_entities during the transmission of data_units between two wireless_stations of the mobile_wireless_network. In this case__user_data is assembled by a first convergence_protocol_layer of the first wireless_station into at least one first data_unit  particularly a packet_data_unit  before transmission to a second convergence_protocol_layer of a second wireless_station  particularly on the same protocol_level  with the user_data being supplied to the first convergence_protocol_layer by at least one user in a network_layer. At least one protocol_entity of the first convergence_protocol_layer is configured as a function of a configuration_request_received by the second wireless_station  in order to form the at least one first data_unit from the data_received from the at least one user and to transmit it through a carrier to a link_control_layer.
