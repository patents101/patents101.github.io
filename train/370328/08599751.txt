Provided is a control_method of a control_apparatus for a multi-cell_communication_system_including a plurality of cells  the method_including_determining a cell_edge_terminal or an inner cell_terminal from each of terminals_included in each of the cells  and selecting  from base_stations_included in the plurality of cells  a first base_station and a second base_station. The first base_station may serve all of a corresponding cell_edge_terminal and a corresponding inner cell_terminal  and the second base_station may serve only the corresponding inner cell_terminal between the corresponding cell_edge_terminal and the corresponding inner cell_terminal.
