Method for determining_location of a wireless_computing_device in a defined_area includes arranging at least one WiFi beacon relative to the defined_area such that a wireless_computing_device in the defined_area is detectable__causing each beacon to generate_information about detection of a wireless_computing_device in the defined_area  providing the generated_information to a processor  and at the processor__determining a location of the wireless_computing_device in the defined_area by processing the information_generated by the beacon s . The wireless_computing_device is not configured to send_information to the processor so that the determination of the presence and/or location of the wireless_computing_device in the defined_area is performed at the processor using only information_provided by the beacon s .
