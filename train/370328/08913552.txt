Techniques for annotating_data_packets with time and/or location_information in wireless_networks are provided. In one aspect  a method for processing_information_streams_produced by end-computing_devices that are transmitted over a wireless_network having at least one network_element is provided. The method includes the following steps. Data packets which originate from the end-computing_devices and are received by the network_element are inspected for spatiotemporal_metadata. Spatiotemporal metadata is inserted into the data_packets and the data_packets are transmitted if the step of inspecting the data_packets_reveals that the data_packets are missing_spatiotemporal_metadata. Otherwise the data_packets are transmitted if the step of inspecting the data_packets_reveals that spatiotemporal_metadata is already present in the data_packets.
