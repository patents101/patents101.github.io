A method and an apparatus for providing channel_quality_information in a wireless_communication_system are disclosed. According to one embodiment of the invention  a method for transmitting_channel_quality_information includes receiving a downlink_signal__calculating a channel_quality_information_index for the received_downlink_signal at least based on a number of resource_elements for a physical downlink shared channel  PDSCH  wherein the number of resource_elements for the PDSCH is determined at least based on an overhead of a demodulation reference signal  DMRS  and transmitting the calculated_channel_quality_information_index.
