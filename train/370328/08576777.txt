A method for transmitting_subframe_grouping_information is provided. The method includes updating a grouping_information_field of a media access control  MAC  message  which a serving_base_station_periodically_broadcasts to a mobile_station  MS  using subframe_grouping_information_determined by a target_base_station  and periodically_transmitting the MAC message to the MS. The method provides downlink_signaling for supporting variable Transmission Time Intervals  TTIs  of a base_station when handover is performed  thereby minimizing_service_delay of each mobile_station and enabling_efficient_utilization of resources.
