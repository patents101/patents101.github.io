In a radio_system where wireless_nodes are in contact  the wireless_nodes are enabled to exchange_information with adjacent_nodes. In addition  in one embodiment_distant_nodes out of range for direct_communication can be communicated with by forwarding_data over multiple_hops. When a user  in particular a primary_user  is detected by a node  a spectrum_access_blocking_message is sent  to other nodes in the vicinity of the node thereby enabling_blocking of the radio_resource in a geographical_area in which the other usage is detected. This means that the radio_resource is blocked in that area from being accessed by other users than the primary_user. The blocking_message can be distributed in any suitable_manner and can be tailored for the application at hand.
