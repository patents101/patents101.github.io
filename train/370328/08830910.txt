A wireless_communication_device includes a transceiver_configured for communication using multiple_communication_modes  the transceiver_comprising a transmitter and a receiver. A plurality of antennas is coupled to the transceiver. The plurality of antennas includes a first antenna and a second antenna. The multiple_communication_modes include a multiple input multiple output     MIMO     mode and a single_antenna_receive_mode. The device further includes a control_circuit_configured to detect_selection of the single_antenna_receive_mode as an active one of the multiple_communication_modes and to automatically_alter a configuration of the plurality of antennas and transceiver by configuring the first antenna as a transmit only antenna and the second antenna as a receive only antenna_responsive to detection of the selection of the single_antenna_receive_mode. Related methods of operation are also discussed.
