A method for use in a cellular_system with a controlling_node and user terminals  UEs. In the system  UEs can assume one of at least two states  a non-listening_state  i.e. a state during which a UE does not listen for data from its controlling_node  and a listening_state  an    on duration____state. According to the method a UE in the system is able to alternate between said two states according to a certain scheme  the scheme according to which a UE in the system_alternates between said two states being dependent on whether or not data_units which are transmitted between the UE and its controlling_node are received entirely and correctly within an initially_allocated_resource for each data_unit.
