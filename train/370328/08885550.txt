Beacon symbols are sent periodically from the base_stations in an OFDM system. The entire_power of the base_station  or a large_portion of it is concentrated in these symbols  thus they are very easily_recognized by the mobile_stations. The frequencies upon which these symbols are transmitted and the time at which they are transmitted_communicates_information such as the base_station/sector_identity and the preferred_carrier of the given base_station/sector to the mobile_station. In order to avoid_collision between the beacon_symbols of different base_stations and sectors  the beacon_symbols from different base_stations/sectors are transmitted at different symbols_times and on different subcarriers.
