A method for simultaneously_transmitting_packets having different lengths to two or more users in a wireless_communication_system includes  generating the packets which are to be transmitted to the respective_users  and simultaneously_transmitting the generated_packets to the respective_users. Each of the packets contains information on the position of a symbol to which a tail_field of the packet_belongs  and the information on the position of the symbol to which the tail_field_belongs includes at least one of the maximum_symbol_number of the packet  the symbol_number of transmission_data of the packet__positional_information of a last aggregated MAC protocol data unit  A-MPDU  subframe  and positional_information of a null_delimiter.
