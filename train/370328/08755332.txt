When time_resource_data that is assigned to a downlink_control_channel_signal is reported on the downlink  the present_invention_improves the reliability of the time_resource_data that is reported  and prevent_purposeless_repetitions of retransmission_requests. A base_station_apparatus___20   is provided herein  which jointly_codes a carrier_indicator of a basic_frequency_block with time_resource_data_assigned to a downlink_control_channel_signal corresponding to a downlink_shared_channel_signal__generates a downlink_control_channel_signal_including the coded_carrier_indicator as the downlink_control_channel_signal corresponding to the downlink_shared_channel_signal  and transmits the generated_downlink_control_channel_signal by the basic_frequency_block_assigned to the downlink_control_channel_signal.
