Disclosed are a node and a method of transmitting_packets from the node. The disclosed_node may use a directional_antenna for transmitting a packet. The node includes a determining_unit and a forwarding_unit. The determining_unit may determine whether or not there is an actor_node_present in a region_traversed by a packet_forwarding_direction  where the packet_forwarding_direction is determined from relative-location_information of a destination_node with respect to a source_node  the region is one of a plurality of regions_divided by particular angles  and the plurality of regions have multiple_beam_patterns of the node_formed therein. The forwarding_unit may transmit the packet to an actor_node_present in the region_traversed by the packet_forwarding_direction or transmit the packet to a neighbor_node_present in the region_traversed by the packet_forwarding_direction.
