A structured_wireless_mesh_network is disclosed where a tree-like connection_topology is formed. In one embodiment  each node has separate_uplink and downlink_radios_operating on different channels. When a cluster of such nodes becomes isolated as in the case of a mobile_mesh_application  a node in the cluster according to this invention_acts as a root_node thus enabling the tree_structure to persist  even in isolation. Example methods of joining sub networks are disclosed that guide the joining of mesh_networks and channel_management. Nodes that may operate in isolation also support a distributed DHCP capability such that IP addresses are assigned to clients even when a connection to a central DHCP server is unavailable.
