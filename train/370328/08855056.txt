A method and apparatus for processing_degradation of radio_link_quality in a wireless_communication_system_supporting_relays are disclosed. The method includes determining_quality of a radio_link between the first node and the communication_apparatus__recovering the radio_link between the first node and the communication_apparatus  when the quality of the radio_link between the first node and the communication_apparatus is decreased to or below a predetermined_threshold  and transmitting to the second node a signaling to control_communication on a radio_link between the second node and the communication_apparatus  when the quality of the radio_link between the first node and the communication_apparatus is decreased to or below the predetermined_threshold.
