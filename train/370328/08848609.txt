Techniques are provided for a foreign_controller to receive a handoff_message_including_information for a multicast_group that is used to forward_network_control_information_originating from an Internet Protocol version 6  IPv6  network router by a home_wireless_controller to one or more foreign_wireless_controllers for mobile_client_devices that were first associated with the home_controller. The foreign_controller_joins a multicast_group_based on the information_contained in the handoff_message and establishes a communication_path with a mobile_client_device. The foreign_controller_extracts_network_control_information_addressed to the mobile_client_device_received from the home_wireless_controller via a multicast_stream associated with the multicast_group  and forwards the network_control_information to the mobile_client_device via the communication_path.
