The present_invention provides a method for duplexing_communication  and a method and a system for scheduling a terminal. The method for scheduling a terminal includes  determining_capability_information of the terminal when the terminal_makes a request for a service__allocating a band_resource for the terminal according to the capability_information of the terminal and the currently available band_resources  and sending_information of the allocated_band_resource to the terminal in the band currently used by the terminal  wherein the allocated_band_resource includes a bidirectionally used band  and at least one of the uplink_band and downlink_band includes a unidirectional_band  and communicating with the terminal in the manner of time_division_duplexing by way of the allocated_band_resource. The present_invention_makes the best of the band_resources near the TDD licensed band and improves the communication_efficiency.
