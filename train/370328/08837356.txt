Disclosed are a method for identifying a connection__mobile_station and base_station. The method_comprises the steps of  assigning a MS ID to the mobile_station when the mobile_station_enters into the coverage_area of the base_station  and assigning a connection ID to a connection when the connection is established between the base_station and the mobile_station. With the proposed_solution  the data_overhead could be reduced_due to short Connection ID instead of 16-bit CID in 802.16e  especially for VoIP traffic. In addition__due to adjustable_bit-length of Connection ID  the tuple    MS ID  Connection ID    could flexibly_support different numbers of connections while keeping_overhead in minimal.
