A system and a method for switching_mobile_station_identification_information in a wireless_communication_system are provided. A method for transmitting_mobile_station_identification_information includes  when a base_station_receives a RaNGing  RNG -REQuest  REQ  message from the mobile_station__sending  at a base_station  a RNG-ReSPonse  RSP  message including a temporary_mobile_station_identifier to the mobile_station__determining  at the mobile_station  the temporary_mobile_station_identifier in the RNG-RSP signal  when base_station_receives REGistration  REG -REQ message including the temporary_mobile_station_identifier from the mobile_station__sending  at the base_station  a REG-RSP message comprising a mobile_station_identifier of the mobile_station to the mobile_station__determining  at the mobile_station  the mobile_station_identifier in the REG-RSP message and sending a response_signal for the REG-RSP message to the base_station  when receiving the response_signal for the REG-RSP message  deleting  at the base_station  the temporary_mobile_station_identifier of the mobile_station  and communicating  at the mobile_station and the base_station  using the mobile_station_identifier.
