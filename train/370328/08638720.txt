Methods  program products  and systems for multi-tier_detection of a geofence are disclosed. In general  in one aspect  a mobile_device can be configured to perform a task when the mobile_device_enters a geographic_region. The mobile_device can monitor a current_location using a multi-tiered_approach. A baseband_subsystem can monitor a coarse_location of the mobile_device using a CDMA system identifier  a CDMA network identifier  a CDMA zone identifier  or a CDMA base station identifier  in that order  as the mobile_device_moves_closer to the geographic_region. The baseband_subsystem can notify an application_subsystem when the mobile_device is in a cell that intersects the geographic_region. The application_subsystem can perform the task upon notification.
