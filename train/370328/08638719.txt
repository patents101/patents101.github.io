Inter-cell interference coordination of multiple_transmission_ranks can be accomplished by various methods and apparatuses. For example  a method can include defining_indexing of resources for which a base_station will restrict a maximum_rank for transmission. The method can also include informing a neighboring_base_station of the first base_station about the resources for which the base_station will restrict the maximum_rank of transmission.
