A method for connecting to a network from a mobile_terminal_capable of forming a high-performance_radio_channel in a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System  UMTS  and an apparatus_implementing the same are provided. The method includes transmitting a Radio Resource Control  RRC  connection request message indicating a first release_version to the network__receiving an RRC connection setup message indicating a second release_version from the network__comparing the first and second release_versions__determining whether there is a third release_version_lower than the first release_version and higher than the second release_version when the second release_version_differs from the first  and  if there is the third release_version_lower than the first release_version and higher than the second release_version__transmitting an RRC connection request message indicating the third release_version to the network when the second release_version_differs from the first release_version.
