A demodulation_reference_signal_port_mapping_method is disclosed. The method includes  a base_station_communicates with a User Equipment  UE  and allocates corresponding data_stream to the UE according to the attribution of the UE  the base_station_maps the corresponding data_stream from a layer to a corresponding demodulation_reference_signal_port  the base_station_transmits the corresponding data_stream to the UE via demodulation_reference_signal_port. By restricting the demodulation_reference_signal_port_mapping_solution of rank_1 to rank_8 and the demodulation_reference_signal_port_mapping_solution when the retransmission_occurs  the technical_solution_enables the demodulation_reference_signal_port_mapping_solution to be compatible with the present_system and to keep lower_overhead of the demodulation_reference_signal.
