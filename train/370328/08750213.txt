A system_receives  from a mobile_station  a connection_request that specifies a particular application_type. In response to determining that the connection_request is to be denied  the system_sends a response_denying the connection_request to the mobile_station  where the response includes a delay_time that is applicable to the particular application_type but not to another application_type  and where the delay_time indicates an amount of delay that the mobile_station is to wait before resending another connection_request.
