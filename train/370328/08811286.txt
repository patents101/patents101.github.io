Timing division multiplexing is conducted between the cells to avoid_intercell_interference. Transmission timing in a time_slot_pattern has a given interval. A base_station_determines the transmission_timing_based on measured_uplink_interference_power. For example  an uplink_time_slot_pattern in which the measured_uplink_interference_power is smaller is selected. A downlink_time_slot_pattern is assigned so that a response to HARQ is returned at that timing. If traffic is busy__additional_time_slot_pattern may be assigned. In determination of the traffic_volume  for example  the queued_buffer_size  the number of connected_terminals  or the number of connections to a higher-level_device can be used. Assignment timing can be an initial_setup_time  or a fluctuation_detection_time of a channel which can be realized by collection of report_information on a downlink_communication_quality__periodic_monitor of uplink_interference_information.
