Wireless-device-to-wireless_device  WD-WD  interference in a full-duplex_wireless_network is managed by an uplink_transmit_power_control_technique that minimizes_interference_experienced in downlink_signals at other wireless_devices in the wireless_network. In one exemplary_embodiment  an instantaneous_antenna_gain of the wireless_device and a target uplink Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio  SINR  of an uplink_signal of the wireless_device to the home_base_station are determined at the wireless_device. A Noise plus Interference level at the home_base_station is received by either a closed-loop or an open-loop_feedback_technique. The uplink_power_level for an uplink_signal of the wireless_device is determined_based on the determined_antenna_gain  the determined target uplink SINR and the received Noise plus Interference level at the home_base_station.
