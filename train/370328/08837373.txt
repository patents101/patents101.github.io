Relay node   110   main_unit___113   for a relay_node and method in a main_unit___113   for a relay_node   110   which main_unit___113   is connectible to a first radio_unit___111   and to a second radio_unit___112   for synchronising_wireless_communication over the second radio_unit___112   with wireless_communication over the first radio_unit___111  . The method_comprises_transmitting a synchronisation_signal at the second radio_unit___112___receiving the signal at the first radio_unit___111   to compute a first timing_difference corresponding to the signal_propagation_time and to adjust the downlink_transmission_timing at the second radio_unit___112   according to the first timing_difference. Similar signalling  estimation of timing_difference and adjustment is made for signals to be received from the user_equipment___130   at the second radio_unit___112  .
