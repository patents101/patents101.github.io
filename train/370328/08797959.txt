A method for operating a controller of a multiple_input__multiple_output_communications_system includes formulating an objective_function according to a resource_allocation for a user equipment  UE  and a mean square_error_expression  and updating the objective_function to generate an updated_resource_allocation for the UE  a transmit_beamforming_vector to precode a transmission to the UE  and a receive_beamforming_vector to adjust a receiver to receive the precoded_transmission. The method also includes transmitting_allocation_information about the resource_allocation for the UE and the transmit_beamforming_vector to a communications_controller_serving the UE.
