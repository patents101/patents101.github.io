The invention_deals with the adjustment of the nominal_target_error_rate for transmission of data from a priority_queue to a new predetermined_target_error_rate_depending on the state of the priority_queue. Usually  the adjustment to the new predetermined_target_error_rate will be to a predefined_lower_target_error_rate_based on states of the priority_queue  such as amount of data in the priority_queue__time_passed since the latest_transmission of data from the priority_queue  whether the amount of data in the priority_queue will fit into one transport_block  whether the data_unit to be transmitted for the priority_queue is the first or last data_unit in the priority_queue and may also be based on the type of data_stored in the priority_queue. There may be more than one such priority_queue.
