In order to improve continuous packet connectivity  CPC  the present_invention provides a method of improving CPC for a UE working in a HS-SCCH less operation in a wireless_communications_system. The method includes treating a received_data as a specific_data to be decoded when the received_data is the data of the third transmission for a base_station and the data in a soft_buffer_pointed by the third transmission is not the second transmission for the base_station in the wireless_communications_system.
