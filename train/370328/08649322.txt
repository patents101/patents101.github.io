A method and system for controlling_access to a wireless_communication_medium are disclosed. The system includes at least one access point  AP  and at least one station  STA . The AP defines a superframe for transmission of data in a time_domain having a high throughput  HT  period which includes at least one scheduled resource allocation  SRA  and at least one management SRA  MSRA . The AP broadcasts an extended beacon  EB  including information about the SRA and MSRA. The SRA is defined for transmitting_traffic_data between the AP and the STA  and the MSRA is defined for transmitting_management and control_data between the AP and the STA. The system_reduces_station_battery_consumption__supports_higher_throughput for non-real time  NRT  traffic and is more efficient for real time  RT  traffic while maintaining_full_compatibility.
