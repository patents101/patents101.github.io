Systems and methods for performing a handoff of an access_terminal from a macro_node to a femto_node are disclosed. In one embodiment  the femto_node is configured to transmit a predetermined_signal for determining_signal_quality and an identifier that uniquely_identifies the femto_node to the access_terminal. The access_terminal is configured to transmit the identifier to the macro_node. The femto_node is identified as a hand in target_based on the transmitted_identifier and the macro_node is configured to hand in the access_terminal to the femto_node.
