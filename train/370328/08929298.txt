An apparatus and method for performing_procedures__protocols  of a PDCP  Packet Data Convergence Protocol  layer and an RLC  radio layer in an E-UMTS  Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System  which has evolved from UMTS  among radio_protocols of a mobile_communication_system. The PDCP layer performs ciphering on data  i.e.  PDCP SDU  received from an upper_layer__generates an indicator_discriminating_ciphered_data and non-ciphered_data  i.e.  an ROHC feedback packet directly generated by the PDCP layer  and transmits the same to a lower_layer  i.e.  MAC layer . A PDCP SN  Sequence Number  is defined as an algorithm for ciphering the data in the PDCP layer to perform_ciphering in the PDCP layer.
