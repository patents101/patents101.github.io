A method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving_downlink_control_information in a mobile_communication_system_supporting an uplink_packet_data_service are provided. To transmit_packet_data in an HARQ mobile communication system  a second transceiver_receives an RG as rate_control_information from a first transceiver. The second transceiver_sets the allowed_maximum_data_rate of an HARQ process to which the RG is applied to the allowed_maximum_data_rate of an HARQ process previous to the HARQ process  if the RG indicates hold. The second transceiver_transmits_packet_data within the set_allowed_maximum_data_rate to the first transceiver.
