An LTE uplink soft demapper includes an SC-FDMA symbol noise power meter   22   configured to individually_determine a noise_power_measure for each SC-FDMA symbol in a slot by exploiting_information_contained in modulated_data_symbols of the corresponding SC-FDMA symbol. A bit_soft value normalizer___24___connected to the SC-FDMA symbol noise power meter   22   is configured to normalize_bit_soft_values__representing_reliability of received_bits_obtained from the SC-FDMA symbols in the slot__based on the determined_noise_power_measures.
