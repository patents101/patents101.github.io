The first remote is configured for transmitting one of the contention_requests within a selected_period of time after receiving one of the contention_frames from the access_point. The access_point is configured for transmitting one of the contention_grants to the first remote after receiving one of the contention_requests from the first remote. The first remote is configured for transmitting one of the data_frames within a selected_period of time after receiving one of the contention_grants from the access_point.
