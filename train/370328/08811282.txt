A system and method to provide_call_delivery to an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem  IMS  network for a Mobile Directory Number  MDN  homed in a second generation  2G  wireless network  without requiring Wireless Intelligent Network  WIN  operations and associated Mobile Switching Center emulation  MSCe  translations for routing the call_request. A Home Location Register  HLR  determines whether the subscriber has subscribed to the IMS services. The HLR-based subscriber profile is enhanced with new IMS-related subscriber information. Enhanced American National Standards Institute-41  ANSI-41  Mobile Application Part  MAP  operations and a new ANSI-41 parameter allow the MSCe to re-route the call_origination_request from a Public Switched Telephone Network  PSTN  to an entry_point for the IMS network based upon the new IMS-related subscriber information received from the HLR. A Domain Name Server  DNS  supports routing-related traffic distribution.
