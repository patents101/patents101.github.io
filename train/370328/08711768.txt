Techniques for selecting a serving_base_station for a terminal by taking into account_backhaul_capability are described. The terminal may be within the coverage of multiple_base_stations  which may be of different types and may have different backhaul_capabilities. One of the base_stations may be selected as a serving_base_station for the terminal_based on the backhaul_capabilities of these base_stations. The serving_base_station may also be selected_based on additional_criteria such as data or delay_requirements of the terminal__transmit_power_capability of the terminal__characteristics of data for the terminal  etc.
