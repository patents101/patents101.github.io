A system for providing an IP-based wireless telecommunications device with access to an IP-based wireless telecommunications service provided by a carrier_network includes an access_point that sets up a radio_link with the IP-based wireless telecommunications device and couples the IP-based wireless telecommunications device to the network. The system also includes a network_controller in communication with the carrier_network and the access_point. The network_controller is configured to receive_data_packets corresponding to the IP-based wireless telecommunications device at the access_point. The network_controller is also configured to accept/reject the provision of the IP-based wireless telecommunications service to the IP-based wireless telecommunications device based on an IP address or other unique_identifier associated with the access_point.
