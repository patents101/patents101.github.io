The present_invention provides a communication_network for facilitating_monitoring of an athletic_activity. In one exemplary_embodiment  such a communication_network includes a base_station and a first monitor_configured to be coupled to an individual  wherein the base_station is configured to transmit a first beacon_message  wherein  in response to receipt of the first beacon_message  the first monitor is configured to transmit an endpoint_message_including a characteristic of the individual  and wherein the base_station is configured to receive the endpoint_message  and  if the base_station does not receive the endpoint_message by a determined_time  the base_station is configured to transmit a second beacon_signal  the second beacon_signal_including_instructions to a second monitor to transmit the endpoint_message  i.e.  the same endpoint_message_transmitted by the first monitor .
