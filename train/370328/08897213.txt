A system and method for communicating_wirelessly from a mobile_device to a remote_receiver_station is disclosed. The system includes a controller_configured to monitor a status of the mobile_device and  upon an initiation_event__initiate a data_transfer_process to wirelessly_communicate_data to the remote_receiver_station. The system also includes a voice-band_modem that  upon initiation of the data_transfer_process. The voice-band_modem is configured to receive_data for transfer to the remote_receiver_station__encode the data using a fountain_code_encoding_protocol to form a series_encoded_packets  and repeatedly_transmit the encoded_packets until receiving an indication that the series of packets has been received at the receiving_station.
