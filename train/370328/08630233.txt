Provided is a communication_method of a vehicular_access_point  a vehicular_user_equipment  and a macro_base_station for a user_present in a vehicle_capable of effectively_forming an operational_relationship between the vehicular_access_point and the macro_base_station using a plurality of operational_modes. The plurality of operational_modes may be differentiated_based on an operation of the vehicular_access_point and the macro_base_station  and are capable of transitioning the vehicular_access_point from an active_state to an idle_state by a triggering with respect to the vehicular_access_point.
