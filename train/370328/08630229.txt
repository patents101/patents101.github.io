Embodiments of a base_station and method for reducing_asynchronous_interference in a multi-tier OFDMA overlay network are generally described herein. In some embodiments  a lower-tier_base_station is configured to adjust OFDMA frame boundaries to cause frames_communicated by a higher-tier to arrive within a cyclic_prefix at the lower-tier_base_station. The lower-tier_base_station may also be configured to adjust OFDMA frame boundaries to cause frames_communicated by a lower-tier of the network to arrive within a cyclic_prefix at a higher-tier_mobile_station. Accordingly  frames from one tier may arrive within the cyclic_prefix of another thereby reducing_asynchronous_interference.
