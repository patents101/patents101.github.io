A method and terminal for sending a scan_report_based on a multi-carrier_system are provided. The method_comprises the following steps  a terminal_acquiring a first configuration_parameter of carrier s  indicated by a base_station and a second configuration_parameter_needed for the terminal to send a scan_report  wherein the carrier s  indicated by the base_station is one of or a plurality of carriers of the base_station and/or a neighboring_base_station of the base_station  and the terminal_scanning the carrier s  indicated by the base_station according to the first configuration_parameter__generating a scan_report  and sending the scan_report to the base_station according to the second configuration_parameter.
