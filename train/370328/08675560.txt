Communication in a dominant_interference_scenario may be supported by performing inter-cell interference coordination  ICIC . According to certain aspects of ICIC  resource coordination/partitioning may be performed to allocate_resources to a serving Node B located near the vicinity of a strong interfering Node B. The interfering Node B may avoid_transmitting on the allocated/protected_resources  but transmissions from the interfering Node B on resources not allocated to the serving Node B  i.e.  unprotected  may cause significant_interference on cell-specific reference signal  CRS  tones of the serving Node B. Therefore  if the CRS tones of the unallocated/unprotected_resources are used  performance_degradation may result to various operations of the serving Node B. Therefore  certain aspects of the present_disclosure_provide_techniques for a UE receiver in utilizing resource partitioning information  RPI  for performing CRS processing in a heterogeneous network  HetNet .
