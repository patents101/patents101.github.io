Apparatus and methods for a user equipment  UE  to initiate an inter-system_transfer of a communication_session include listening for communications from a first and a second technology_type_network. Further  the aspects include establishing a circuit_switched_session with the first technology_type_network and establishing a packet_switched_session with a serving_node of a first one of the first or the second technology_type_network. Also  the aspects include determining to transfer the packet_switched_session to a target_node of a second one of the first or the second technology_type_network. Additionally  the aspects include transmitting a message  by the UE  to the target_node  thereby causing the technology_type_network of the target_node to fetch_information about the packet_switched_session from the other network of the serving_node in order to effect the transfer and continuation of the packet_switched_session.
