A method for transmitting ACK/NACK signal in a wireless_communication_system_applied_carrier_aggregation is disclosed herein. More specifically  the method includes receiving_multiple_transmission_blocks respectively through multiple_downlink_component_carriers from a base station  determining ACK/NACK responses corresponding to each of the multiple_transmission_blocks by decoding the multiple_transmission_blocks__mapping the ACK/NACK responses to a ACK/NACK state information  and transmitting the ACK/NACK state information through a single_uplink_component_carrier  wherein ACK information included in the ACK/NACK state information indicates a number of ACK response among the ACK/NACK responses.
