What is disclosed is a method of operating a wireless_communication_device. The method includes entering a first wireless_communication_mode with a wireless_access_node that requires_tuning to a first frequency_spectrum  and receiving_congestion_information of the wireless_access_node for overhead_communications of the first wireless_communication_mode. In response to entering the first wireless_communication_mode  the method includes setting a timer for monitoring a second wireless_communication_mode_based on the congestion_information. When the timer_expires  the method includes tuning away from the first frequency_spectrum to a second frequency_spectrum for the second wireless_communication_mode and monitoring_information for the second wireless_communication_mode.
