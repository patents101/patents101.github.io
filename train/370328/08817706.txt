The invention_relates to a gateway_device for a vehicle that is provided in a vehicle  is connected to an out-vehicle_network  an in-vehicle_information_system_network  and an in-vehicle_control_system_network  and controls_data_communication between the three networks. The gateway_device for a vehicle has a function of changing the priority of the data_communication between the in-vehicle_information_system_network and the in-vehicle_control_system_network with respect to the data_communication between the out-vehicle_network and the in-vehicle_information_system_network  according to traveling_conditions of the vehicle.
