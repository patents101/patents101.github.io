A breakout_system initiates RLC resets to resynchronize_data_communication to improve_quality of experience for the user. Synchronization of radio_traffic is monitored and maintained by the breakout_system. When data is broken out  the RLC function is split into two different flows  between the UE and the breakout_system and between the breakout_system and the RNC. When the sequence_numbers of the two flows become out of sync the ciphering_context will become out of synchronization_resulting in errors. The breakout_system can initiate an RLC reset into both of these flows to resynchronize the data_communication to improve_user s quality of experience.
