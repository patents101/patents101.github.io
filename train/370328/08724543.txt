A method for assisting the adaptation of a signal from a first node___100   to a second node___120   is provided. The first node_communicates with the second node in a wireless_communication_system___110   over a radio_link___130  . The second node is configured to comprise a codebook  which codebook_comprises a set of possible information_alternatives used for assisting the adaptation of a signal from the first node to the second node. The second node may select an information_alternative from a codebook and send it to the first node to assist the first node how to adapt the signal. The first node is arranged to know a number of subsets  each subset_comprising a part of possible information_alternatives. The method_comprises the steps of sending a configuration_request to the second node to restrict the selection of information_alternatives to one of the subsets__receiving an information_alternative from the second node  which is selected among the at least one subsets_configured according to the configuration_request.
