The present_invention_relates to a technique_relating to a method and apparatus for generating__transmitting  and receiving a data_frame having a newly_proposed_format in a wireless_communication_system. According to the technique  the method for generating a data_frame in a wireless_communication_system_comprises the following steps__generating at least one first subframe__generating at least one second subframe  and generating a data_frame_including the first and second subframes  wherein the first and second subframes include length_information of a MAC protocol data unit  MPDU  contained in the first and second subframes  and the length_information of the MPDU contained in the second subframe is zero.
