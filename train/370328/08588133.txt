A mobile_communication_system includes a base_station_control_apparatus  and first and second type_base_stations having a receiving_unit that receives a predetermined_signal_transmitted from the base_station_control_apparatus. The base_station_control_apparatus includes a type_determining_unit that determines whether a type of the base_station is the second type_base_station  a transmission_period_setting_unit that sets a transmission_period of the predetermined_signal for the base_station_determined to be the second type_base_stations by the type_determining_unit  to be longer than a transmission_period of the predetermined_signal for the base_station not determined to be the second type_base_station  and a transmitting_unit that periodically_transmits the predetermined_signal to the base_stations__based on a transmission_period_set for each of the base_stations by the transmission_period_setting_unit.
