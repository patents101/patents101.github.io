A method and system for connection_management in a wireless_data_network  such as a 1xEV-DO network_adds_connections to new network_sectors upon receipt of a connection_request from an active_terminal  but removes_data_connections that the active_terminal_requests to be dropped only after confirmation from the active_terminal that a channel_allocation_message has been received and applied. The active_network_maintains an active_set of connections that is at least as large as the active_set_maintained by the active_terminal and does not initiate a connection_termination if no confirmation of the channel_allocation_message is received. This allows for a reduction in the number of dropped_connections.
