Systems and methods for Long Term Evolution  LTE  interface correlation are described. In some embodiments  a method may include receiving a first message  the first message having been intercepted over an air  Uu  interface of an LTE network  e.g.  probed via a Common Public Radio Interface  CPRI  between an Evolved-Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network  UTRAN  Node B  eNB s remote_radio_head and baseband_processing_unit  the first message having a first identifier. The method may also include receiving a second message  the second message having been intercepted over the S1 interface between the eNB and a Mobility Management Entity  MME  within an Evolved Packet Core  EPC  portion of the LTE network within a given time_window from the first message  the second message having a second identifier. The method may further include correlating the first and second messages in response to a match between the first and second identifiers.
