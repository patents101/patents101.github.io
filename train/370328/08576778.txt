Networks  network_devices and methods of synchronization using transfer of synchronization_packets are provided. Some network_devices are configured to use either a timing_reference_extracted_based on GPS signals or an imported_timing_reference  as an operative_time_reference. A network_device from which to import the time_reference is selected and may be updated to meet a selection_rule_related to the quality of receiving the transfer of synchronization_packets.
