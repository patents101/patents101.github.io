The present_invention_discloses a method and an apparatus for triggering a status_report in a RLC acknowledged mode protocol. The technical_scheme includes  A  constructing and transmitting a status_report at a data_receiving_end of a RLC layer when a reordering_timer is timeout or a packet for setting a polling_bit is received from a transmitting_end  B  determining whether the data_receiving_window is in smoothly_moving_status  and if in the smoothly_moving_status__enabling a status_prohibit_timer_immediately after the status_report has been transmitted  and considering the retransmission_triggered by the status_report at this time to be successful  and if the data_receiving_window is not in the smoothly_moving_status__performing_step C  C  detecting whether the retransmission_triggered by the status_report at this time is successful  and if successful__enabling the status_prohibit_timer.
