The present_invention is a system and method for packetizing_actual_noise_signals__typically_background_noise__received by an access_gateway from a speaking_party and transmitting these packetized_noise_signals via a network to an egress_gateway. The egress_gateway_converts the packetized_noise_signal into noise_signals_suitable for output and transmits the output_noise_signals to a listening_party. When the access_gateway_detects that no voice_signal is being received and only a noise_signal is being received for a predetermined_period of time  the access_gateway_instructs the egress_network to continually_transmit_output_noise_signals to the listening_party and ceases to transmit_packetized_noise_signals to the egress_gateway.
