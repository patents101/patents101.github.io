A relay_device_performing_wireless_communication with a wireless_communication_device to relay_communication between the wireless_communication_device and another communication_device. First and second relay_modes of the relay_device each include a set of communication_parameters for relaying_communication via respective first and second communication_paths. The relay_device includes a communication_failure_determination_section for determining  whether there is a communication_failure in the first communication_path  and a relay_mode_controlling_section for enabling the first relay_mode and disenabling the second relay_mode when there is no communication_failure in the first communication_path  and disenabling the first relay_mode and enabling the second relay_mode when there is a communication_failure in the first communication_path. A communication_control_section_controls_communication_based on either the first relay_mode or the second relay_mode that is enabled by the relay_mode_controlling_section.
