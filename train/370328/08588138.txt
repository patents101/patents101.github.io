Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate_compressing_headers for relay_nodes. In particular  a plurality of internet protocol  IP  headers  tunneling protocol headers  and/or other routing_headers in a packet can be compressed to facilitate_efficient_communications of packets between relay_nodes and/or a donor_access_point. A donor or other upstream_access_point can be provided with a filter_mask__bit_stream  and filter_mask_identifier_generated by a related_relay_node for packets having given static_header_data. Thus  the donor or other upstream_access_point can apply the filter_mask to incoming_packet_headers  and where a resulting_bit_stream_matches the received_bit_stream  can replace at least a portion of the packet_headers with the filter_mask_identifier. The relay_node can subsequently_decompress the packet_headers_based on the filter_mask_identifier. Similar functionality can be used for compressing_uplink_communications.
