A method for tracking_wireless_access_points from a computing_device. The method includes scanning in a first scan to identify_wireless_access_points that are within wireless_communication of the computing_device  and scanning in one or more subsequent_scans to identify_wireless_access_points that are within wireless_communication of the computing_device. The method also includes creating a group of wireless_access_points that includes a combination of wireless_access_points that were identified in the first scan or in the one or more subsequent_scans  and providing to a user of the computing_device a list of wireless_access_points that includes members of the group of wireless_access_points that have been identified in a predetermined_period of multiple_scans for wireless_access_points.
