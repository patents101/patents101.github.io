A wireless_communication_apparatus of the invention has a determination_section that determines which one of a plurality of formats is used for determining_transmission_symbols to be transmitted to another communication_apparatus  a control_section that determines a type a sequence_length of an orthogonal_code and used for assigning ACK/NACK symbols to identical_symbols in an identical_slot on basis of the format_determined by the determination_section  without depending on a number of transmission_symbols_capable of being transmitted to the other communication_apparatus  a spreading_section that spreads the ACK/NACK symbols by an identical_type of orthogonal_code in the plurality of formats_set_based on the type and the sequence_length of the orthogonal_code_determined by the control_section  and a transmission_section that transmits the spread ACK/NACK symbols using the determined_format.
