A method and system is disclosed for coordinating_codec_assignment and radio_configuration in wireless_communication_sessions. When a communication_session is set up for an access_terminal  AT  operating in a wireless_communication_system  a network_device  such a base_station  can determine a coding_rate to assign the AT for its air_interface in a manner that accounts for radio_configuration in a wireless_coverage_zone of the base_station. The base_station could use a distribution of types of cover_codes in use to monitor_radio_configuration  and then assign a codec and coding_rate for new calls_based on the distribution.
