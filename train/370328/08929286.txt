Even when the lengths of data_items to be transmitted to users are not the same  the frames_multiplexed at the same time_finally have the same frame_length and are transmitted. Even when the lengths of frames for the users are not the same at the time when a transmission_request is received from a higher_layer  a communication_apparatus_reconfigures at least two of the frames having short_lengths into a frame having a long_length through Aggregation so that the frames_finally have the same frame_length and transmits the frames at the same time in a multiplexed_manner. On the transmitter_side  the transmission_power used per destination_communication_station can be increased_due to a decrease in the total_number of multiplexed_frames. On the receiver_side  an unstable AGC operation can be prevented.
