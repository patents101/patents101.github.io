In general  techniques are described for atomically_installing and withdrawing_host_routes along paths_connecting_network_routers to attenuate_packet_loss for mobile_nodes_migrating among wireless LAN access networks and a mobile_network. In some examples  whenever the mobile_node_moves from one attachment_point to the next  it triggers the distribution of its host_route from the new attachment_point toward the service_provider_network hub provider edge  PE  router that anchors the mobile_node on a service_provider_network. Routers participating in the Mobile VPN install the host_route____atomically    from the attachment_point to the mobile_gateway so as to ensure_convergence of the network_forwarding_plane with the host_route toward the new attachment_point_prior to transitioning_mobile_node_connectivity from a previous_attachment_point.
