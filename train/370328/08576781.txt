Methods and systems for providing voice and date_services in a femtocell_wireless_network. The proposed approach integrates IWLAN architecture into femtocell_architecture by introducing a gateway to serve both IWLAN and femtocell_users. The proposed_approach_handles the voice and data in a different way so that it enhances the data_handling_efficiency while re-using existing MSC investment. The proposed_approach_carries the data_traffic from a femtocell_base_station to the gateway in native IP packet  instead of encapsulating them in 3G data  thus enhancing the efficiency and performance for the data_traffic. The data_traffic can then be sent to GGSN or directly to packet_data_network. The approach_tunnels_voice_traffic to MSC through the gateway as in conventional Iu-CS approach.
