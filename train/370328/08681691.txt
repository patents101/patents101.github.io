The normal_roles of wireless_stations and wireless_access_points in initiating the establishment of wireless_connections may be reversed without the need for changes in the network_interfaces for either the station or access_point_device. This capability may be used to allow wireless_devices_acting as access_points  but on which service_clients_operate  to initiate the establishment of a connection with a station  on which a wireless_service_provider_operates. Discovery of services between wireless_devices can be provided_prior to establishing a connection between the devices. A service_client_device providing access_point_functionality may broadcast an invitation for service_advertisements and then receive_service_advertisements from relevant_service_providers_acting as wireless_stations. An information_element may be included as part of periodically_broadcast_administrative_messages to wirelessly_convey an invitation for service_advertisements. In response to a service_advertisement  the access_point may send to the wireless_station an invitation to connect__prompting the wireless_station to begin to establish a connection according to a wireless_communication_protocol.
