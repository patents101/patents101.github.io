A new deployment_model_enables a seamless_migration to LTE  long term evolution /EPC  Evolved packet core . In addition  an intelligent edge gateway  IEG  supports future distributed_architecture and a converged_network for service_providers. Specifically  the model_supports_existing_data_services  e.g. UMTS  and the delivery of LTE services does not affect the existing_data_services. Moreover  a distributed_architecture is employed  such that  local_traffic is optimally_routed at the edge and backhaul is minimized. The system can also provide_support for enhanced Femto cell 3GPP access to a home_network.
