A disclosed_user_device_generates an uplink_control_channel_including at least one of acknowledgement_information and a channel_quality_indicator regarding downlink and transmits the uplink_control_channel via a dedicated_frequency_band when no resource is allocated for transmission of an uplink_data_channel. The uplink_control_channel includes multiple_unit_blocks_constituting a subframe and each of the unit_blocks includes a sequence_generated by multiplying all chips of an orthogonal_code_sequence_assigned to the user_device by the same factor.
