A local_gateway_assignment_capability is depicted and described herein. In a wireless_service_provider_network  the local_gateway_assignment_capability_enables a local_gateway  rather than a core_gateway  to be selected to serve a user_request for an APN. The local_gateway and core_gateway may be a Local-GGSN  L-GGSN  and a GGSN  respectively  where the L-GGSN is associated with an SGSN and provides local_traffic_offloading for the GGSN and where the GGSN provides a gateway for the core_network_portion of the wireless_service_provider_network. A DNS element or other device is configured to determine an SGSN-specific APN in response to receiving a DNS Request from an SGSN. A DNS element is configured to identify  using an SGSN-specific APN associated with an SGSN  an L-GGSN associated with the SGSN  and to provide an indication of the L-GGSN to the SGSN from which the DNS Request is received  thereby enabling the user associated with the DNS Request to use the L-GGSN rather than the GGSN.
