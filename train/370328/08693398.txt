In general  techniques are described for facilitating interchassis redundancy  ICR  among heterogenous_mobile_gateway_member_chassis that provide_high-availability_services as an group to one or more mobile_subscribers. In one example  a member_chassis of the mobile_gateway_comprises a control_plane having a plurality of distributed_subscriber_management_service_units that serve as anchors for subscriber_sessions. A redundancy_group_defines a backup_association between one of the subscriber_management_service_units and a subscriber_management_service_unit of another member_chassis of the mobile_gateway. A routing_unit of the member_chassis_comprises a resource_manager that negotiates_parameters for a communication_channel for the redundancy_group. A session_management_daemon_establishes_subscriber_sessions_anchored by the subscriber_management_service_unit in the association and sends  via the communication_channel__subscriber_session_data for the subscriber_sessions_anchored by the subscriber_management_service_unit.
