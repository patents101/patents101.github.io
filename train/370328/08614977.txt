A wireless_communication_signal in Long Term Evolution  LTE  may be interleaved in a manner which permits a partitioning of a received_inter-column_bit-reversed_interleaved_code_block for improved_de-interleaving. The code_block may be divided into equal_subportions which may be simultaneously_de-interleaved both forward and backward  and in parallel with other subportions. An even number of subportions may be provided. Dividing a received_code_block in this manner may improve_de-interleaving_performance.
