A network_bridging_adaptor and method for enabling_nodes to access a multi-tier_wireless_home_mesh_network is described. The network_bridging_adaptor is adapted to operate in an ad_hoc_network having access_restricted to only wireless_nodes that are provided from a common_entity. According to one embodiment of the invention  the network_bridging_adaptor_comprises a housing  one or more ports_positioned along a side of the housing to receive_data from an electronic_device  a first radio_logic_unit_contained within the housing and adapted to transmit and receive_messages in order to detect a presence of the ad_hoc_network  and a second radio_logic_unit_contained within the housing and adapted to operate as an access_point by establishing_communications with nodes that are provided by an entity different than the common_entity. Other embodiments are described and claimed.
