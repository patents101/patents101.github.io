A user equipment  UE  determine to activate a data_session. The UE configures a data_session_activation_request_message to include an indication of an association with communication_sessions of a given type  e.g.  delay-sensitive_communication_sessions  and then transmits the data_session_activation_request_message to an access_network. The access_network_determines to establish an aggressive_paging_cycle of a downlink_channel for the UE based in part upon receiving a message  e.g.  which can be different than the data_session_activation_request_message  that conveys the indication of the association to the access_network. The access_network_sends at least one instruction for facilitating an allocation of the aggressive_paging_cycle to the UE  and the UE receives the at least one instructions and monitors the downlink_channel accordingly.
