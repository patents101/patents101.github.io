Providing adaptive channel state feedback  CSF  reports in discontinuous reception  DRX  scenarios in a power-efficient_manner. The described algorithm may be able to make_adaptive_decisions to carry over the CSF from previous DRX cycles based on channel conditions  DRX cycle length  and/or the requirements of CSF reporting for current DRX cycle. The proposed_approach can allow for more efficient_power_consumption_related to CSF reports in DRX scenarios where new CSF reports have little or no impact to throughput.
