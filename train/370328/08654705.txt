Techniques for rank_adaptation and multiple-stream_reverse_link_communications in a wireless_access_network are disclosed. A remote_unit_transmits one or more reverse_link_data_streams using separate_identifiers to a base_station. The number of reverse_link_data_streams may be determined according to feedback from the base_station or it may be determined by testing one or more multiple-antenna_transmit_hypotheses. The base_station may estimate_channel_conditions using information_obtained from the one or more reverse_link_data_streams and may determine a spatial_rank of the communication_channel. The remote_unit may perform_separate_error_control and power_control_processes for each reverse_link_data_stream in cooperation with the base_station.
