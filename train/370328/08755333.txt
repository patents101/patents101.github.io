Method and apparatus for computing a noise_power_estimate in a wideband CDMA  WCDMA  network are disclosed and may include calculating a noise_power_estimate for a downlink_channel_based on an orthogonal_sequence_generated for a transmitted_signal. The orthogonal_sequence may be generated_based on a slot_number of the transmitted_signal and/or a transmit_diversity_mode used for the transmitted_signal. A portion of a plurality of dedicated physical channel  DPCH  pilot bits for the downlink_channel may be summed to generate an in-phase  I  component and a quadrature  Q  component. The generated I component and the generated Q component may be multiplied by the orthogonal_sequence to generate at least one noise I component and at least one noise Q component.
