The present_invention_relates to a method for transmitting_frames from a transmitting_mesh_device to a receiving_mesh_device in a mesh_network__comprising__storing_frames_received in the transmitting_mesh_device from a source_mesh_device and intended for a destination_mesh_device in a relay_queue  the source_mesh_device and the destination_mesh_device being different from the transmitting_device__storing_frames_generated by the transmitting_mesh_device in a local_queue  different from the relay_queue__selecting a frame from the relay_queue or local_queue_based on a predetermined_scheduling_strategy_____transmitting the selected_frame to the receiving_mesh_device.
