Provided are a method and apparatus for uplink_transmission in a multi-antenna_system. A terminal_transmits a plurality of first transmission_symbols via a plurality of antennas using a first spatial_processing_performed on the first transmission_symbols  and transmits a plurality of second transmission_symbols via a plurality of antennas using a second spatial_processing_performed on the second transmission_symbols. At least one column or at least one row of a first spatial_processing_matrix used in the first spatial_processing is switched to form a second SFBC matrix used in the second spatial_processing. According to the present_invention__peak-to average power  PAPR /cubic metric  CM  ratio can be kept at a low_level  and imbalanced_transmission_power among antennas can be evened out.
