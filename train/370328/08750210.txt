A method for providing a radio_architecture for a long term evolution  LTE  communication system is disclosed. According to one aspect  a radio provides power_pooling and direct_up-conversion of signals to be transmitted. Power pooling is provided by adjusting the gain and phase of each of a plurality of carrier_signals in a digital_matrix_based on feedback_signals_received from an analog_matrix  such that the output_signals are coupled to one or more selected_radio_output_ports. Direct up-conversion is achieved by up-sampling and filtering the carrier_signals to be transmitted.
