In some embodiments  an apparatus includes a core_network_node_configured to be operatively_coupled to a set of wired_network_nodes and a set of wireless_network_nodes. The core_network_node is configured to receive  at a first time  a first data_packet to be sent to a wired_device_operatively_coupled to a wired_network_node from the set of wired_network_nodes. The core_network_node is configured to also receive  at a second time  a second data_packet to be sent to a wireless_device_operatively_coupled to a wireless_network_node from the set of wireless_network_nodes. The core_network_node is configured to apply a common_policy to the first data_packet and the second data_packet_based on an identifier of a user associated with both the wireless_device and the wired_device.
