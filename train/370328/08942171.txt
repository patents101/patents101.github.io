The present_disclosure_relates to a technique for performing_physical_layer_measurements on a frequency_resource_relative to other frequency_resources in a telecommunications_system_operable to communicate over multiple_frequency_resources. A method_aspect of this technique includes determining that a mobile_terminal is to perform a physical_layer_measurement with regard to a first frequency_resource__determining if there is data to be communicated over one or more second frequency_resource s  within a time_period wherein the first frequency_resource is distinct from the second frequency_resources  if it is determined that there is no data to be communicated over the second frequency_resource s  within the time_period__performing the physical_layer_measurement on the first frequency_resource and forming a quality_measure of the first frequency_resource_based on the physical_layer_measurement  or if it is determined that there is data to be communicated over the second frequency_resource s  within the time_period__modifying the physical_layer_measurement and forming a quality_measure of the first frequency_resource_based on the modified_physical_layer_measurement.
