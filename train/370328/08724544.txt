A method of transmitting a packet  at a MS and base_station_operable using multiple_communication_schemes is disclosed. The base_station of the multiple_communication_schemes_receives a packet from the MS and then determines a transmission_path_based on a link_status of a network  a traffic_characteristic of the packet and the like. The base_station_transmits the packet of the first communication_scheme via a network using a second communication_scheme  thereby enabling_traffic_redirection. Such a resource as a frequency_band and the like  which will be used between networks using different communication_schemes  can be cooperatively_set between the MS and the base_station.
