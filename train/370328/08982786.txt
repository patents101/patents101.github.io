An initial_access_setting_information_generating_apparatus includes a preamble_information_transmission_number_obtaining_unit that receives and obtains the number of transmissions for preamble_information in a non-contention_type_initial_access_procedure_performed between a base_station and a communication_terminal  where the preamble_information_transmission_number_obtaining_unit_receives and obtains the number of transmissions after the initial_access_procedure is completed  an expected_reception_power_determination_unit that determines an expected_reception_power at the base_station__based on the number of transmissions for the preamble_information  which is obtained by the preamble_information_transmission_number_obtaining_unit  and a set value communication_unit that generates and outputs_initial_access_setting_information about the initial_access_procedure for the communication_terminal__based on the expected_reception_power_determined by the expected_reception_power_determination_unit.
