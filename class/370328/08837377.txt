A mobility management entity  MME  for setting up a call includes a first network_interface which receives a tracking area update  TAU  request from a user equipment  UE . The MME includes a processing_unit which translates the TAU request into a location area update  LAU  request. The MME includes a second network_interface in communication with the processing_unit which sends the LAU request to a mobile switching center  MSC  selected as a tracking MSC thereby establishing the MME as a network_node through which the UE is paged.
