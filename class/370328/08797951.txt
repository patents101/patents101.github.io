A communication_system includes transfer_node__200__receiving a registration_request_signal from mobile_node  100  and server__300__receiving the registration_request_signal from transfer_node__200 . Transfer node  200  determines  depending on the type of a transmission_trigger for the registration_request_signal_occurred  whether or not the number of mobile_nodes which will be registered or which will have registration_expiry_time_postponed are a plurality. If the plurality of mobile_nodes are not to be processed__transfer_node__200__transmits a registration_request_signal for one mobile_node to server__300 . If the plurality of mobile_nodes are to be processed__transfer_node__200__transmits an aggregation_registration_request_signal concerning the plurality of mobile_nodes  to server__300 . Server  300  executes a process of registering or postponing the mobile_node or the plurality of mobile_nodes according to signal_received from transfer_node__200.
