A cell_searching_procedure is modified to enable a user_terminal to determine whether a detected_signal_originates in a known cell or a new cell having the same cell_identifier as the known cell. When a signal is detected  the user_terminal_determines the cell_identifier and timing of the detected_signal. If the cell_identifier_matches a known cell and the timing is outside the timing_window of the known cell  the user_terminal_compares_detected_signal with a corresponding received_signal_received from the known cell having the same cell_identifier as the detected_signal_source. The user_terminal_determines__based on said comparison  whether the detected_signal is from the known cell or a new cell.
