A set of different communication_flows___270 - 272   can be established between a set of end-user_devices___210   and remote_devices___265   through an intermediary_node___225  . For each communication_flow___270 - 272   a flow-specific_bearer___250   can be generated between the intermediary_node___225   and a corresponding one of the remote_devices___265  . Each bearer___250   can have quality of service_attributes that correspond to flow-specific_quality of service_attributes of the flow___270 - 272   to which the flow-specific_bearer___250___corresponds. Communication can occur between each of the proximate_end-user_devices___210   and the remote_devices___265   in accordance with the flow-specific_quality of service_attributes. The intermediate_node___225   can direct the exchanged_data between unique_local_communication_links and corresponding ones of the flow-specific_bearers___250  .
