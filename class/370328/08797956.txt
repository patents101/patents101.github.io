A radio_base_station includes a mobile_communication_system that sends and receives_control_signals between a mobile_station and a mobile_switching_center via a first radio_bearer  a second radio_bearer  and a wired_bearer. The relay_node includes a first radio_bearer_function  a second radio_bearer_function  an IP layer function  an SCTP layer function  and an application_layer_function. The radio_base_station includes a second radio_bearer_function  a wired_bearer_function  and an IP layer function. The mobile_switching_center includes a wired_bearer_function  IP layer function  SCTP layer function  and an application_layer_function. Keep-alive processing is performed between the SCTP layer function of the relay_node and the SCTP layer function of the mobile_switching_center. Security processing is performed between the IP layer function of the relay_node and the IP layer function of the mobile_switching_center.
