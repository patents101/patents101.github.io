Provided is a plug-and-play_wireless_network_extension_system and a method of automatic_connection for the system. The system at least has a wireless Ethernet extension controller and at least one wireless Ethernet extension station. The controller and the station_preferably_adopt a power-line_communication_technology to accomplish an initial_connection and data_transferring. While the connection is done  an automatic_connection_process is initiated. By means of an automatic_exploration_mechanism to search any existed wireless Ethernet extension controller  the station_obtains the controller s network_address. The station then automatically_establishes the connection and receives the wireless_network_configuration from the controller. It is featured that the system_achieves a plug-and-play_effect to simplify the process for expanding the coverage of wireless_signals.
