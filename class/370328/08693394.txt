A method of discovering a neighbor_cell  the method_including__determining whether a first Primary Synchronization Channel  PSCH  of a first cell in which a terminal is included is identical to a second PSCH of a second cell  and whether timings of the first cell and the second cell are synchronous__estimating third channel_information of the second cell_based on second channel_information of the first cell from first channel_information  when the first PSCH is identical to the second PSCH and the timings of the first cell and the second cell are synchronous  the second channel_information being estimated using a first Secondary Synchronization Channel  SSCH  of the first cell  and the first channel_information being estimated using the first PSCH and the second PSCH  and detecting a second SSCH of the second cell  and detecting a cell identifier  ID  of the second cell using the second SSCH.
