The method provides for establishing a communication_session in a hierarchical_communication_system between a source_party and at least one destination_party. Hierarchical communication systems generally have communication_nodes at different levels of hierarchy. In one embodiment__connection_information for the communication_session is stored if establishing the communication_session is blocked at a node as a result of a blocking_condition at the blocking_node. Establishment of the communication_session is initiated_based on the stored_connection_information if the blocking_condition no longer_exists at the blocking_node.
