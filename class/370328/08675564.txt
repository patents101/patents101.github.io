A multi-cell_transmission_diversity_method and apparatus that is capable of forming two virtual_antennas of each cell and producing_orthogonality of the virtual_antennas using an improved_precoding_technique in an OFDM-based cellular mobile communication system is provided for improving_transmission_diversity_gain with coherent_combination of the orthogonal_signals at the receiver. A multi-cell_transmission_diversity_transmission_method of a transmitter according to the present_invention includes generating a first signal_stream and a second signal_stream by performing_transmission_diversity_encoding on a user_data__multiplexing and precoding the first signal_stream and a first dedicated_reference_signal into a first diversity_signal__multiplexing and precoding the second signal_stream and a second dedicated_reference_signal a second diversity_signal  and transmitting the first and second diversity_signals_simultaneously  wherein the first dedicated_reference_signal and the second dedicated_reference_signal are user-specific_reference_signal_signals.
