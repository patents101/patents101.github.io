The present_invention provides a method for recording the unsuccessfully_transmitted_downlink_data_volume into the CDR generated by gateway_support_node in a telecommunication_system. The method includes creating_information_relating to the unsuccessfully_transmitted_downlink_data in a node and sending the information from the node to the gateway_support_node  to make the gateway_support_node know the volume of unsent_downlink_data. A node and gateway_support_node which adapted to prevent_overcharging the user which is caused by the G-CDR are also provided.
