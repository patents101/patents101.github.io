This invention is directed to a terminal_apparatus_capable of preventing the degradation of reception_quality of control_information even in a case of employing SU-MIMO transmission system. A terminal___200   which uses a plurality of different layers to transmit two code_words in which control_information is placed  comprises  a resource_amount_determining_unit___204   that determines__based on a lower one of the encoding_rates of the two code_words or based on the average value of the reciprocals of the encoding_rates of the two code_words__resource_amounts of control_information in the respective ones of the plurality of layers  and a transport_signal_forming_unit___205   that places  in the two code_words  the control_information_modulated by use of the resource_amounts  thereby forming a transport_signal.
