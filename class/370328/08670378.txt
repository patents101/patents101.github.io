A transform_domain_multi-user_detection and interference_suppression_apparatus for femtocell is disclosed. The transform_domain_multi-user_detection and interference_suppression_apparatus is applied in a telecommunication_system_including a plurality of user_equipments. The transform_domain_multi-user_detection and interference_suppression_apparatus includes a multi-user_signal_processing_module_including an interference_suppression_unit. The multi-user_signal_processing_module_receives a plurality of user_signals from the plurality of user_equipments. During an interference_suppression_phase  the interference_suppression_unit of the multi-user_signal_processing_module_focuses on one of the plurality of user_signals in the transform_domain and reduces the other user_signals in the transform_domain by using a specific_operation_method. During an interference_cancellation_phase  the multi-user_signal_processing_module_receives an estimation of the plurality of user_signals in the transform_domain and reconstructs the received_signals according to the estimation.
