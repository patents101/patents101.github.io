Some demonstrative_embodiments include devices__systems and/or methods of selectively_aborting_reception of wireless_communication_packets. For example  a receiver may at least partially_process a portion of a wireless_communication_packet  to determine_based on the portion of the communication_packet whether the packet is intended to be received by the receiver and  if the packet is not intended to be received by the receiver  to abort_processing of a remainder of the communication_packet by one or more components of a physical_layer of the receiver. Other embodiments are described and claimed.
