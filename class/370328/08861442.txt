A power_control_method_performing a power_control_operation between a radio_network_controller and a node B is provided. The method includes steps of  calculating a packet_error_rate_threshold and a base_received_packet_count according to a target block error rate  BLER  and a precision of the target BLER  obtaining an accumulated_received_packet_count and an accumulated_packet_error_count__increasing a target signal-to-interference ratio  SIR  of the node B when the accumulated_packet_error_count is greater than a product of the accumulated_received_packet_count and the packet_error_rate_threshold__decreasing the target SIR when the accumulated_received_packet_count is greater than or equal to a product of the base_received_packet_count and a threshold_parameter  and resetting the accumulated_received_packet_count and the accumulated_packet_error_count after the target SIR is adjusted.
