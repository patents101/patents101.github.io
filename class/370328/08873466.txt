A system or circuit for generating_timing_events for mobile_communications includes fetching_network_parameters corresponding to a cellular_network. The network_parameters are used to program a set of programmable_registers. The timing_events then are generated_based on the network_parameters. The timing_events_enable a user equipment  UE  or a base_station to operate in multiple_cellular_networks.
