A system for providing service-specific_support for multimedia_traffic in a telecommunications_system_comprises a subscriber_terminal  a base_station_operatively_coupled to the subscriber_terminal  a mobile switching center  MSC  operatively coupled to the base_station  a media gateway control function  MGCF  and a media gateway  MGW  each coupled to the MSC. The subscriber_terminal is adapted to generate_multimedia_traffic of at least one service_category  wherein the multimedia_traffic may be any of several distinct_types_defined within the service_category. The subscriber_terminal is further adapted to identify  when establishing a connection to the MSC to carry_multimedia_traffic  the type of that traffic in a connection_request_message. The MSC is adapted to further identify  when establishing a connection between the MSC and the MGCF/MGW to carry_multimedia_traffic  the type of that traffic in a message__responsive to the identification of the traffic_type in the connection_request_message. The MGCF/MGW are adapted to identify  when converting__reformatting  or encapsulating_multimedia_traffic into a form to be carried over a packet_network  for example  in TCP segments  the type of traffic being carried. The MGCF  MGW  or MSC may optionally_perform_service-specific_processing on the multimedia_traffic_responsive to the traffic_type_indicator. When multimedia_traffic is delivered to a destination_network for ultimate_delivery to a destination_endpoint  an MGCF/MGW may reverse the effects of prior_service-specific_processing.
