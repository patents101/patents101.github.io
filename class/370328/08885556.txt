A method of performing hybrid automatic repeat request  HARQ  in a multiple_carrier_system is provided. A user_equipment_receives a plurality of downlink_data through a plurality of downlink_carriers and transmits one acknowledgement  ACK /not-acknowledgement  NACK  signal for the plurality of downlink_data through an uplink_carrier. The ACK/NACK signal is an ACK signal when all of the plurality of downlink_data are successfully_received.
