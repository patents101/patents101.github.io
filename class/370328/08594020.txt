A wireless_communication_system includes a plurality of base_stations that can switch to either first or second communication_method and that communicates_wirelessly with terminals by the switched_communication_method and a control_apparatus that manages the plurality of base_stations. The control_apparatus includes  an acquisition_unit that acquires  from each base_station__throughput of the base_station and RSSI of each terminal that communicates_wirelessly with the base_station  and a switch_instruction_unit that instructs to each base_station_switch the current_communication_method when there is  among the plurality of base_stations  a base_station in which throughput has decreased within fixed_interval  and instructs to re-switch to the communication_method before switching to base_stations in which throughput before and after switching of communication_method is same but a specific_standard__based on RSSI after switching of communication_method  is not satisfied.
