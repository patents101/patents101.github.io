Baseband recovery in wireless_networks__base_transceiver_stations  and wireless_networking_devices may be implemented to minimize the number of timing_symbols while at the same time_enabling_wireless_devices to use a relatively low_per-symbol_sampling_rate  so that minimal_processing is required to implement the timing_recovery. In one embodiment  a relatively low_number of samples is taken per expected_symbol_interval during the training_sequence. A subset of the samples is selected and processed to determine_error_signals for each of the samples. The error_signals are multiplied by the expected_symbol and summed to form an error_signal. The error_signal is used to adjust the set of samples that will be used and processed in connection with subsequent_symbols. The error_signal is also used to interpolate between available samples to infinitesimally_approach the point of maximum_eye_opening.
