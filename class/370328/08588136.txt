A system and method for SSS detection under carrier_frequency_offset in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access  OFDMA  downlink channel. A processor_receives a signal_sample that includes a transmission on a primary synchronization signal  PSS  and a transmission on a one secondary synchronization signal  SSS . The processor_determines a correlation    P    of a first symbol_transmitted in the PSS of the signal_sample to a first known symbol at each time    t    of time_increments k of the signal_sample and a correlation    S    of a second symbol_transmitted in the a SSS to a second known symbol at each time_t-.5/7_msecs. The processor_receives a candidate_phase_rotation of    i  from a set of    i    candidates and determines a correlation    Cmax    over the time_increments k representing a maximum_amplitude of a combined_correlation of S and P  with P rotated by    i . The processor_determines the cell_identifier from the first and second known symbols that produced S and P of C max and an estimation of the frequency_offset between a transmitter of the signal_sample and a receiver of the signal_sample.
