Systems  methods  and apparatuses of a wireless_communications_network include identifying a resource_collision between uplink_channels for acknowledgement/negative acknowledgement  ACK/NACK  signaling of a first component_carrier and a second component_carrier. An indicator_representative of the ACK/NACK signaling of the first component_carrier and the second component_carrier can be identified.
