A method for allocating_polling_bandwidth may include generating_polling_tokens corresponding to connections_maintained by a base_station. The polling_tokens may be generated at configurable_time_intervals. The method may also include assigning_priorities to the polling_tokens. The priority of a polling_token may depend on a scheduling_type of a corresponding connection. The method may also include allocating_polling_bandwidth to the connections that correspond to the highest_priority_polling_tokens when uplink_bandwidth is available to allocate for polling.
