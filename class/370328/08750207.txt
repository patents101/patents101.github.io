A method and apparatus for adapting_transmission to improve_quality of service in a mobile_wireless_device that includes an application_processor and a transceiver. An application_service_connection is established between the mobile_wireless_device and a remote_device. The transceiver in the mobile_wireless_device_monitors_real_time_properties of a radio_frequency_access_link that transports_packets for the application_service between the mobile_wireless_device and a wireless_communication_network. The transceiver provides local_feedback to the application_processor of updated_values of the monitored_real_time_properties. The application_processor_adjusts_packet_data_generation and transmission in response to the updated_values to manage_quality of service for the application_service_connection. Packet data transmission adjustment includes active_management of queues in the transceiver by the application_processor__selectively_dropping_packets_based on packet_classifications and the local_feedback_information_provided to the application_processor.
