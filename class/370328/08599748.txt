An adaptable_decision_parameter is used to determine whether to react to resource_utilization_messages. The decision_parameter may comprise a decision_threshold that is adapted_based on received_resource_utilization_messages. The decision_parameter may comprise a probability that is used to determine whether to react to a received_resource_utilization_message. Such a probability may be based on  for example  one or more channel_conditions  the number of interferers seen by a node  the number of received_resource_utilization_messages  or some other form of resource_utilization_message-related_information.
