A wireless_communication_apparatus_including an MMSE combining processing unit that performs MMSE combining based on frequency_domain_received_signals_obtained by performing a discrete Fourier transform on received_signals  the apparatus_including an amount-of-phase-rotation_estimating_unit that estimates an amount of phase_rotation_occurring in the frequency_domain_received_signals_due to a shift in discrete Fourier transform timing of the received_signals  and a reverse_rotation_unit that applies a reverse_rotation of an amount of rotation corresponding to the amount of phase_rotation_estimated by the amount-of-phase-rotation_estimating_unit  to the frequency_domain_received_signals  wherein the MMSE combining processing unit computes an MMSE weight based on the frequency_domain_received_signals to which the reverse_rotation has been applied by the reverse_rotation_unit  and performs MMSE combining.
