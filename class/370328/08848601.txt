A method for receiving_data using a user agent  UA  configured to communicate with a wireless_communications_network using a first and second communication_carrier is presented. The method includes receiving_control_information at a first time_interval using the first communication_carrier. The control_information_allocates a resource on at least one of the first communication_carrier and the second communication_carrier. The control_information indicates whether a carrier_switch is required. In one implementation  when the control_information indicates a carrier_switch is required  the method includes ceasing_signal_reception on the first communication_carrier  and receiving a signal on the second communication_carrier.
