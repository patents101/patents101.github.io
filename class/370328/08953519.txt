A method of transmitting a data_signal in a wireless_communication_system from a primary_station to a secondary_station  where the data_signal includes a medium_access_control_header  MAC-hs header  and a protocol_data_unit associated with the medium_access_control_header. The medium_access_control_header includes a set of fields  TSN  SEG  LI  LCid . The method includes determining a size_allocated to at least one field of the set_based at least in part on a length of the protocol_data_unit. For example  the size_allocated to a segmentation_indication field  SEG  determined for a first length of the protocol_data_unit is lower than the one determined for a second length of the protocol_data_unit  where the second length being higher than said first length  where the segmentation_indication indicates in how many segments the protocol_data_unit is subdivided.
