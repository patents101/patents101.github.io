A data_receiving_apparatus includes a receiving_unit_configured to receive a beacon_packet from at least one base_station  a searching_unit_configured to search an index of a subchannel_including an optimal_channel_state among subchannels_allocated to a sector_divided through spatial_multiplexing_based on the base_station using the beacon_packet  a calculating_unit_configured to calculate a final_back off time by adding a slot_time of the subchannel_index and a random_time  and a transmitting_unit_configured to include the searched_subchannel_index in a beacon_response_packet and transmit the beacon_response_packet after the calculated_final_back off time.
