Methods  servers and systems for performing_dynamic_context_based_routing_operations in a telecommunications_signaling_network in which a dynamic_context_based_router may receive a first message_encoding_signaling_information from a source_component__decode the message into an internal_representation__perform_application_level_routing_operations using contextual_information_derived from the internal_representation to identify a destination_component__encode_signaling_information_contained in the internal_representation into a second message  and send the second message to the identified_destination_component. Application level routing operations using contextual_information may include generating_keys_based on the internal_representation__transmitting the generated_keys to an external_resource__receiving_supplementary_information in response to the generated_keys  and using the supplementary_information to identify the destination_component. The information in the internal_representation may be modified to send a subset or a superset of the information_contained in the first message.
