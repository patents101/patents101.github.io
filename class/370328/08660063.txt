A method___300   and apparatus___200   for cell_detection in a wireless_communication_system may include acquiring___315   using a transceiver__synchronization to first radio_frame_boundaries of a first physical_channel from a cell. The method may include attempting to decode_frames___320   of a second physical_channel that has second radio_frame_boundaries that are a multiple of the first radio_frame_boundaries. The method may include performing___325   a cyclic_redundancy_check on the frames of the second physical_channel. The method may include extracting___345___predictable_information from a payload from frames that fail the cyclic_redundancy_check.
