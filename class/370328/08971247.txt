Methods  devices  and systems for retransmitting Media Access Control  MAC  protocol data units  MPDUs  in a multi-user_multiple-input and multiple-output  MU-MIMO  communication system are disclosed. Concurrent data streams within a first transmission_window are transmitted. Each concurrent_data_stream is associated with a different recipient and includes an equal_number of MPDUs. An indication of a retransmission_subset of the MPDUs to be retransmitted for each concurrent_data_stream may be obtained if errors are present. The retransmission_subset for each concurrent_data_stream is retransmitted within a second transmission_window. A length of the second transmission_window is as long as the longest of the retransmission_subsets of the concurrent_data_streams. One or more new MPDUs may be added to the concurrent_data_streams in the second transmission_window so that each concurrent_data_stream in the second transmission_window_carries a same number of MPDUs.
