A radio access network  RAN  may transmit on a plurality of channels  each channel_made up of a plurality of subcarriers. Each subcarrier_defines a sequence of frames  each frame respectively defining a sequence of time_slots. The RAN may transmit_symbols in each time_slot at at least a nominal_power_level on each of the subcarriers. The RAN may also determine a subcarrier that is likely to cause adjacent_carrier_interference between a first wireless_device and a second wireless_device. The RAN may also transmit_null_symbols in a first time_slot of an initial_frame on the determined_subcarrier with a power_level less than the nominal_power_level. Additionally the RAN may transmit_subsequent_symbols with the respective_power_level of each of the subsequent_symbols is successively_increased for each subsequent_timeslot  for at least the duration of the initial_frame.
