A system includes a wireless_leaf_node_configured to modify_operation of an industrial_process. The system also includes a plurality of wireless_access_points_configured to transmit_data to the wireless_leaf_node in specified time_slots and to receive an acknowledgement from the wireless_leaf_node in response to successful_receipt of the data by the wireless_leaf_node. Various communication_schemes are disclosed for supporting_communications between the wireless_leaf_node and the access_points. Each access_point could also include a local_slot_manager_configured to assign the specified time_slots for that access_point to communicate with the wireless_leaf_node. The wireless_leaf_node could represent a wireless_actuator.
