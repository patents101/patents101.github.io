The present_invention is a radio_communication_system in which a radio_transmitting_apparatus_transmits a packet to a radio_receiving_apparatus using a HARQ scheme  including a moving_speed_acquiring_unit_configured to acquire a moving_speed of a radio_communication_terminal which is the radio_transmitting_apparatus or the radio_receiving_apparatus  a selection_unit_configured to select a transmission_method of an information_bit and an error_correction_bit which are transmitted under the HARQ scheme based on the moving_speed_acquired by the moving_speed_acquiring_unit  and a transmitting_unit_configured to perform_initial_transmission and retransmission of the packet according to the transmission_method_selected by the selection_unit.
