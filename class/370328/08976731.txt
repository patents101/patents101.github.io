A method for a base_station_supporting_multicarrier_operation to transmit a paging_message is provided. The base_station_determines a first time_point for multicast broadcast service  MBS -related information and transmits the MBS-related information through a first carrier at the first time_point. Also  the base_station_determines a second time_point for transmitting a paging_message to a mobile_station__determines a second carrier for transmitting the paging_message to the mobile_station  and transmits the paging_message through the second carrier at the second time_point. Here  the second time_point is different from the first time_point.
