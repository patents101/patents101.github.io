A system__method  and computer_readable_medium that facilitates_processing of a mobile-originated_voice_call for a mobile_station_attached with a femtocell_system are provided. The femtocell_system may broadcast a notification that authentication is required for all system_access via an overhead_message_train. The femtocell_system_receives a call_origination_request from the mobile_station and  in turn__issues a service_request_message to a convergence_server_deployed in a core_network. The convergence_server then engages in an authentication_procedure with the mobile_station s mobile_core_network and returns a global_challenge_response to the femtocell_system. The convergence_server may then determine if the mobile_station is to be validated and  if so  may continue_call_set up for the call_origination_request.
