A mobile_device can store a set of first CDMA identifiers including  for example  system_identifiers__network_identifiers  or zone_identifiers. Each first CDMA identifier can be associated with a first geographic_location. The mobile_device can determine a current_location by matching a current first CDMA identifier with a stored first CDMA identifier. If a user_desires a current_location that has finer_granularity  the mobile_device can retrieve a set of second CDMA identifiers including  for example  base_station_identifiers. Each second CDMA identifiers can be associated with a second geographic_location that has a finer_granularity than that of the first geographic_location. The mobile_device can match a current second CDMA identifier from the retrieved second CDMA identifiers and designate the second geographic_location associated with the matching second CDMA identifier as the current_location that has the finer_granularity.
