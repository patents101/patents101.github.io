A method of operating a wireless_network_node of a wireless_communication_network is disclosed. The wireless_network_nodes have at least first and second downlink_transmission_modes  the first downlink_transmission_mode_comprising_normal_operation of a particular network_node and being applicable when a number of active_terminals in a cell associated with the particular network_node is greater than a first mode_threshold value  and the second downlink_transmission_mode_comprising_restricted_downlink_transmission of the particular network_node and being applicable when the number of active_terminals in the cell associated with the particular network_node is less than or equal to a second mode_threshold value. The method_comprises_transmitting a signal_indicative of a current_downlink_transmission_mode of the wireless_network_node. Corresponding computer_program_product and arrangement are also disclosed.
