A wireless_access_network_including a wireless_base_station_configured to  for Iu-CS voice_traffic  act as a network_controller  by  terminating Iu-b signals from user_equipment  and relaying the voice_traffic over Iu-CS via an IP sec tunnel. And for data_traffic__wireless_base_station is configured to act as the network_controller  by  terminating Iu-b signals from the user_equipment  striping IP payload  and sending the data traffic inside IPsec. Further  the wireless_access_network includes a wireless_gateway_configured to act as a security_gateway for Iu-CS voice_traffic  by  establishing the IP sec tunnel with the femtocell_base_station without the support of a GPRS Tunneling Protocol  GTP  as defined over Iu-PS. Also receiving and forwarding the tunneled Iu-CS voice_traffic to a mobile_switching_center  and for data_traffic__encapsulate the IP payload and send it via Gn to GGSN.
