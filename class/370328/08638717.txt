Systems and methods for maintaining a communication_session. A gateway_supports both a local access point  AP  and a virtual AP. The local AP is accessible only to an    owner    of the gateway. The virtual AP  VAP  is accessible to devices associated with the owner of the gateway and to roaming Wi-Fi devices. A datastore_conveys_information about the roaming Wi-Fi devices to the VAP to permit them to access the VAP without the need for manual_configuration of the VAP. A roaming Wi-Fi/cellular device may communicate with a gateway via a tunnel to maintain_session_connectivity during roaming. A session may be initiated on one network  such as a Wi-Fi network or a cellular_network__handed off to another network  such as a cellular_network or a Wi-Fi network  and then returned to network on which the session was initiated.
