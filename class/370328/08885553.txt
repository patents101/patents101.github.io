A method is described of routing a packet_comprising_routing_information between a mobile_host and a correspondent_host in respective first and further network_domains  at least the first network_domain_comprising a plurality of subnets  said mobile_host being attached to one of said subnets. The method_comprises_registering the mobile_host with the first network_domain  said registration_including_assigning a global IP address and a local IP address to said mobile_host  said local IP address being associated with the subnet to which the mobile_host is attached__communicating said local IP address to said mobile_host  using the global IP address as the routing_information between the domains__reformatting said packet by replacing the global IP address with the local IP address upon receipt of the packet in the first network_domain  and communicating the reformatted_request to the mobile_host via the associated subnet. A proxy_server and apparatus for use in this method are also disclosed.
