A first embodiment is a method of calibrating an implicit_beamforming_wireless_system wherein the implicit_wireless_system_comprises a beamformer and a beamformee. The method_comprises_associating the beamformer with the beamformee__sending a sounding_packet from the beamformer to the beamformee__receiving a sounding_response at the beamformer wherein the sounding_response contains explicit_channel_state_information as estimated by beamformee__computing_implicit_channel_state_information at the beamformer_based on transmissions from the beamformee__passing_explicit and implicit_channel_state_information into the beamformer__computing a set of compensation_parameters and loading the set of compensation_parameters into the beamformer thereby enabling the beamformer to implicitly_beamform to a device that does not support_explicit_beamforming.
