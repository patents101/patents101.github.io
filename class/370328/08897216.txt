A method and apparatus for acknowledge mode data  AMD  re-segmentation are disclosed. An AMD protocol data unit  PDU  is generated from at least one RLC SDU. The AMD PDU size is within a flexible maximum AMD PDU size. The original AMD PDU is stored in a retransmission_buffer  and transmitted. If transmission of the original AMD PDU fails and the original AMD PDU size is larger than an updated maximum AMD PDU size  the original AMD PDU is segmented to segmented AMD PDUs. If transmission of one of the segmented AMD PDUs fails  the original AMD PDU may be re-segmented to smaller size AMD PDUs.
