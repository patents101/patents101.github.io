The present_invention_relates to methods and apparatuses for providing network_access  wherein a connection to a core_network is established via a wireless_access_device and a gateway_device. Connectivity of the wireless_access_device is restricted to a pre-defined_group of core_network_address of a pool of gateway_devices with multi-node_connectivity to the core_network  and a single_address is selected to establish the connection to a one of the gateway_devices. The gateway_device is provided with a relay_function for mapping a single_input_address to a plurality of core_network_addresses_based on a location_information of the wireless_access_device and with at least one co-located_decentralized_core_network_functionality.
