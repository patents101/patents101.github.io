Receiving a connection_establishment_request_message sent by a user_equipment__establishing a signaling_connection with the user_equipment according to the connection_establishment_request_message  and transmitting a user plane IP data packet through the signaling_connection. After a signaling_connection is established between a UE in an idle_state and a mobility_management_device  an uplink user plane IP data packet or a downlink user plane IP data packet  is directly_transmitted between the UE and the network_side through the signaling_connection  with no need to specifically_establish__recover  an RAB between the UE and an S-GW  which can save the signaling_overhead  thus reducing the network_load and lowering the operating_cost of an operator.
