A system for wireless_communication_reduces_implementation_complexity for symbol_level_interference_cancellation as applied to physical_control and data_channels  such as the physical downlink shared channel  PDSCH  and physical downlink control channel  PDCCH . A user equipment  UE  categorizes tones of a signal into tone_groups. A different noise_whitening_matrix is applied to each tone_group for demodulation and decoding of the signal.
