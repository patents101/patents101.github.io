A method includes receiving a cross-subframe_assignment in a first subframe__targeting a second subframe in which a transmission power control  TPC  command is to be applied. The method may also include adjusting_transmit_power in accordance with the TPC command during a third subframe  a predefined_number of subframes after the first subframe. Another method includes receiving a cross-subframe_assignment in a first subframe. The cross-subframe_assignment_targets a second subframe in which a first TPC command is to be applied. The method may also include receiving a nominal_grant in the first subframe that targets an identified_subframe to which a second TPC command is to be applied. The method may also include adjusting the transmit_power according to the first TPC command  the second TPC command or a function of the first TPC command and the second TPC command during the second subframe or the identified_subframe.
