Systems and methods that designate a control_attachment_point s  during transmission of data in a Coordinated Multipoint  CoMP  system. The control_attachment_point is represented by an anchor_cell to address_control_signaling and represent a User Equipment s  UE  interaction with the wireless_communication_system from a perspective of control  e.g.  supplying/sending_grants to the UE  transmitting/receiving ACKS on the downlink/uplink to the UE  control information  CQI  and the like.  The cells can further engage in backhaul_transfer of information_therebetween  and dynamic_switching/change of anchor_point_based on criteria such as control_loading__channel_quality  and the like can further be implemented.
