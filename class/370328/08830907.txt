Signals received from channels_exposed to multi-path_propagation via a plurality of diversity_antennas and including at least one pilot_signal are processed by detecting a set of multi-path_components for each received_signal and computing a set of channel_coefficients from multi-path_components of the at least one pilot_signal in the set of multi-path_components. The set of channel_coefficients is organized as a channel_coefficient_vector. From the channel_coefficient_vector  a set of combining_weights is estimated to be applied to the received_signals by  computing a spatial_correlation_matrix of the channel_coefficient_vector by neglecting the correlations between multi-path_components of the channel_coefficient_vector having different delays  whereby the correlation_matrix is a block_diagonal_matrix_including_null_coefficients other than for non-null_sub-matrixes_arranged along the diagonal of the correlation_matrix  wherein the sub-matrixes have a size_equal to the number of diversity_antennas__deriving from the spatial_correlation_matrix a resulting_matrix by calculating the inverse of the sub-matrixes or a scaled_version_thereof  and multiplying the resulting_matrix and the channel_coefficient_vector in order to obtain the desired_set of combining_weights.
