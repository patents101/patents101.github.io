A wireless_device and method for a multiple_carrier_system are provided. The wireless_device_comprises a carrier_management_unit for determining at least one of a plurality of carriers as a reference_carrier for monitoring a control_channel and a control_channel_unit for monitoring the control_channel over the reference_carrier  wherein the carrier_management_unit_switches the reference_carrier to at least one of remaining_carriers of the plurality of carriers. Accordingly  control_channel_traffic can be prevented from concentrating on a particular carrier  and a diversity_gain can be achieved.
