Aspects of this disclosure_provide_systems and methods for generating_models of a wireless_network_environment in an indoor_space which may be used to predict an indoor_location. The disclosure_relates to collecting_wireless_network_access_point_identifier_information and power_level_observed at various locations are collected to generate various signal_maps. The signal_maps may be used to generate_models of the indoor_space. In one example  a voting_model may use a probability_distribution of a plurality of signal_maps in order to identify a location with a highest_probability of overlap with current_signals_received at a client_device. Once a location has been identified  it may be used to assist with any number of navigational_functions  such as providing turn by turn_directions to another indoor_location  for example  a conference_room or exit  or simply providing information about the current_location.
