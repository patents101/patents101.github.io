Embodiments of the present_disclosure_provide a feedback_generator  a feedback_decoder and methods of operating a feedback_generator and decoder. In one embodiment  the feedback_generator is for use in user_equipment and includes a CQI profile module configured to provide a differential_channel_quality_indicator  wherein the differential_channel_quality_indicator_represents a difference between indices corresponding to allocatable_channel_quality_indicators. The feedback_generator also includes a transmit_module that transmits the differential_channel_quality_indicator. In one embodiment  the feedback_decoder is for use in a base_station and includes a receive_module_configured to receive a differential_channel_quality_indicator. The feedback_decoder also includes a CQI selection module configured to provide_allocatable_channel_quality_indicators from the differential_channel_quality_indicator_based on a differential_index  wherein the differential_index_represents a difference between indices corresponding to the allocatable_channel_quality_indicators.
