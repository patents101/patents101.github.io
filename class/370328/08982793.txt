A method for controlling_channel_access_performed by an access point  AP  in a wireless_system is provided. The method includes  receiving at least one frame from at least one station  STA  respectively  for a specific_time_period  each frame_including_information on a contention window  CW  used when the frame is transmitted__processing_information one at least one CW for each STA  determining whether to control the channel_access_based on the processed_information on the CW  selecting an abnormal STA candidate group if it is determined that the channel_access_control is performed  and controlling the channel_access to each STA included in the abnormal candidate STA group.
