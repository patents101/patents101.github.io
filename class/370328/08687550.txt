A system for configuring_base_station_parameters_comprises a base_station  a mobile_station and a code_generating_system. Additionally  a method for configuring_base_station_parameters_comprises_steps of  after a code_generating_system_generates an operation_code  the operation_code is sent to a base_station via a mobile_station  wherein the operation_code includes information_required for performing a configuration_operation  the base_station  if determining the operation_code as received to be valid  then performs the corresponding configuration_operation according to the information_required for performing the configuration_operation. According to the present_invention  without depending on the base_station_controller and other network_elements such as a network_management_system  the base_station can implement_message_interaction over air_link  i.e.  parameter_configuration may be implemented without requiring the base_station to access to the network_management_system  by using a key and a check_code  a parameter_configuration_process which is triggered_inadvertently or maliciously is avoided.
