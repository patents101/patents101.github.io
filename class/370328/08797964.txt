There is provided a wireless_communication_system which can synchronize a mobile_station with a destination_base_station in response to the mobile_station_determining to switch_base_stations. Each base_station_generates_synchronization_information to synchronize the mobile_station with the base_station from a reverse_pilot_signal_received from the mobile_station__generates_reverse_propagation_quality_information from the reverse_pilot_signal  and generates and transmits a control_signal_including the synchronization_information and the reverse_propagation_quality_information. A mobile_station_generates and transmits a reverse_pilot_signal__receives a signal_including the control_signal from each of the base_stations.
