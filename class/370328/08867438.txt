A data_transmission_method for a high-speed_packet_access_system includes  sending  by a user_equipment__packet_data containing scheduling_information having size_information of a packet_buffer through an uplink_channel to a base_station  and sending_quality_indicator_information and acknowledgement_information through another uplink_channel to the base_station__determining  by the base_station  the value of a turbo_mode_flag by comparing_amounts of data_stored in the packet_buffer of the user_equipment and a packet_buffer of the base_station respectively with preset_thresholds  and deactivating  by the user_equipment when the turbo_mode_flag of an order_message_contained in received_control_data__packet_data_reception and control_data_transmission  and redirecting_transmit_power of a specified transmitter to a packet_data_transmitter to increase_transmit_power of the packet_data_transmitter for faster_packet_data_upload.
