A method for transmitting and receiving a hybrid automatic repeat request  HARQ  feedback  and a mobile_station and a base_station using the same are disclosed. A method for allowing a mobile_station to transmit a HARQ feedback in a wireless_communication_system includes receiving two downlink_bursts or one downlink_burst_including two codewords from a base_station  and transmitting an ACK/NACK feedback corresponding to either each downlink_burst of the received two downlink_bursts or each codeword of one downlink_burst_including the two codewords to the base_station. An orthogonal_sequence is applied to the ACK/NACK feedback of the mobile_station so that the resultant ACK/NACK feedback is transmitted via a first HARQ feedback channel  HFBCH  included in a single HARQ mini tile  HMT .
