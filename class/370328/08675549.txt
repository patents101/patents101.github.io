An apparatus and method for serving_sector_maintenance in a wireless_communication_system is described. A forward link serving sector  FLSS  change command  ChangeFLSS  is received and it is determined if a FLSS in the ChangeFLSS command is a member of a NonSynchronousSubset. If the determination is positive  a reverse link serving sector  RLSS  and a dedicated RLSS  DRLSS  in the public_data may be updated to be equal to the FLSS in the ChangeFLSS command  and indications that the RLSS and the DRLSS have changed may be issued. Otherwise  the FLSS and a dedicated FLSS  DFLSS  in the public_data may be updated to be equal to the FUSS in the ChangeFLSS command  and indications that the FUSS and the DFLSS have changed may be issued.
