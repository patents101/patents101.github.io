Techniques for determination of packet_retransmission using a time_threshold are described. In at least some embodiments__information for a packet that is received is compared to information for previously_received_packets. If the information for the packet_matches a previously_received_packet  a receive_time for the packet is compared to a timestamp for the previously_received_packet to determine if the packet is a retransmission of the previously_received_packet. In at least some embodiments__packet_information associated with different senders can be stored  e.g.  to enable_packet_information_comparison for purpose of retransmission_detection. An amount of packet_information that is stored can be limited to a certain number of senders to control the impact of packet_information_storage on memory_resources.
