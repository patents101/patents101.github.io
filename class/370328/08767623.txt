The invention_instantiates a Personal VLAN bridge  using IEEE Std. 802.11_elements. The result is a bridge__referred to as a public_access_point  that is better suited for implementing_public_wireless_data_networks than the IEEE Std. 802.11_architecture. The invention also provides a location-update_protocol for updating the forwarding_tables of bridges that connect_public_access_points together. The invention further provides a method for more controlled_bridging  which is referred to as fine_bridging.
