A counter_synchronization_process is described that is event_driven rather than conducted on a periodic_basis. A receiving_device  which may be a user equipment  UE  or a base_station__monitors_received_data_packets to detect a rollover of a packet_data_sequence_number in successive_data_packets. When the sequence_number_rollover is detected  the receiving_device_increments the variable_data_portion of the deciphering_key_stored in memory. Also in response to this detected_rollover_event  the receiving_device_transmits a synchronization_message to the source_device.
