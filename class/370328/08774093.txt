The present_disclosure provides a system and a method for providing mobility_management and out-of-coverage_indication in a conventional Land Mobile Radio  LMR  system. A radio provides its location and user_group_data to the disclosed_system through its traffic_channel when the channel is idle. Knowledge of the radio s current_location and user_group_data is used to provide_dynamic_call_routing and data_management within the disclosed_system. The disclosed_system and method may provide_operability_similar to that of a trunking_system by providing mobility_management and out-of-coverage_indication while providing low-cost_benefits through operation of a conventional_system.
