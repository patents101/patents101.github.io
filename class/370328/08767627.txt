A multihop_wireless_network includes a plurality of wireless_nodes. Each wireless_node_calculates a metric value indicating a quantity of providing a guideline for selecting a superordinate_destination_node with each candidate for the superordinate_destination_node when carrying out a multihop_wireless_communication with a specific_wireless_node_based on peripheral_node_information about node_information_received from the peripheral_wireless_nodes and determines the superordinate_destination_node_based on the calculated_metric value. The network_system_selects a superordinate_wireless_node as a target_wireless_node_expected to change the number of the wireless_nodes_existing in a subordinate_hierarchy  and intentionally changes a value of the node_information sent from the target_wireless_node to the peripheral_wireless_nodes.
