The amount of multi-antenna_signals to be transmitted over the backhaul in a Coordinated MultiPoint  CoMP  system from the central processor  CP  to each base_station is reduced. Embodiments of the present_invention_exploit_characteristics of the underlying_signal_structure  and distribute some baseband_processing_functionalities   such as channel_coding and the application of the multi-user_precoding   from the CP to the remote_base_stations. Additionally  in some embodiments the non-precoded_parts of multi-antenna_signals are broadcast from the CP to all base_stations in the CoMP system  to further reduce the burden on backhaul_communications. In one embodiment  the backhaul_network is a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network  GPON .
