A wireless_communication_transmitter_configured to transmit a multi-carrier_signal  the multi-carrier_signal being an aggregation of two or more separately_modulated_carriers_occupying_distinct_frequency_regions is operated by obtaining a baseline_multi-carrier_metric_indicative of an amount by which a multi-carrier_signal s maximum_transmit_power should be reduced from a pre-determined_nominal_maximum to satisfy a predetermined_out-of-band_emission_requirement when different scrambling_codes are used on all carriers that are combined to create the multi-carrier_signal. A compensating_metric_adjustment value that compensates for an estimation_error that results from use of a same scrambling_code on two or more of the carriers is estimated. A final_multi-carrier_metric is obtained by adjusting the baseline_metric by an amount_based on the compensating_metric_adjustment value when the same scrambling_code is used on the two or more of the carriers.
