A method and apparatus for supporting Non-Access Stratum  NAS  communication between a User Equipment  UE  and a Mobility Management Entity  MME  efficiently by addressing_signaling_problems_occurring between the UE and the MME in a situation where it is necessary for a network_node to identify the UE information  from another network_node to which the UE has been attached  are provided. The method is implemented with a UE  an MME  and an old MME or an old Serving General Packet Radio Service Support Node  SGSN  to which the UE has been attached before so as to facilitate_discovering a best node using the UE information acquired from the old MME or old SGSN during communication between the UE and the network__resulting in a reduction of a communication_delay between the UE and network and an improvement of communication_efficiency.
