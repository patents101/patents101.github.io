A wireless_communication_system includes  a plurality of mobile_terminals  a plurality of transceivers  each of the transceivers_performing_wireless_communication with a mobile_terminal  a plurality of baseband_processors which modulates_data to be transmitted to one of the transceivers and demodulates_data_received from one of the transceivers  a switch which switches the connection of the transceivers and the baseband_processors  and a controller which calculates an operation_rate of the transceivers and the baseband_processors  respectively  continues or stops a power_supply for driving the transceivers and the baseband_processors in accordance with a calculation_result of the operation_rate  and controls the switch to reconnect the transceivers_coupled to one of the baseband_processor of which the power_supply has been stopped to another baseband_processor of which the power_supply is continued.
