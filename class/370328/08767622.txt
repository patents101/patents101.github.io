Method and system for managing_address_prefix_information associated with handover in network. A fast_handover_process is achieved for point-to-point_communication_model. A mobile_node_send a provisional new care-of-address with an aggregate_prefix_part to its previous_access_router  which forwards the address to a new access_router. The new access_router in response_generates a modified new care-of-address with a unique_prefix_part for the mobile_node. Alternatively  the mobile_node_sends a request to the previous_access_router for a unique_prefix. The request is forwarded from the previous_access_router to the new access_router. The new access_router_assigns a unique_prefix for the mobile_node.
