An apparatus is capable of transmitting_information via an uplink_control_channel in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access  OFDMA  communication system. Uplink control information is encoded to obtain a predetermined_bit_string. A signal_sequence corresponding to the predetermined_bit_string is generated. The signal_sequence is cyclic-shifted according to a predetermined_rule. The cyclic-shifted_signal_sequence is controlled according to a subframe_length. Therefore  reception_performance_deterioration of an uplink_control_channel_allocated to an irregular_subframe can be minimized.
