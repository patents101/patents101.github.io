A wireless_network using network_coding  and a method of adaptively_adjusting_buffering_time in the wireless_network  are provided. A communication_method of a cross_node in a wireless_network  includes determining_information associated with a number of hops between a source_node and the cross_node  and/or a number of hops between the cross_node and a destination_node. The method further includes adaptively_adjusting a buffering_time at the cross_node_based on the information. The method further includes buffering a packet_received by the cross_node_based on the adjusted_buffering_time. The method further includes performing_network_coding of the buffered_packet and another packet.
