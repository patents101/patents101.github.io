Methods  systems  and devices are disclosed for providing data  such as voice_data for a voice_service  over flexible_bandwidth_carriers. Some embodiments include support for 12.2_kbps and/or 7.95 kbps AMR CS voice over flexible bandwidth UMTS  F-UMTS  in particular. Some embodiments_provide for keeping the information_data_rate for a flexible_bandwidth_carrier at least the same as that of a normal_bandwidth_carrier. For example  one voice_frame may still be mapped to a 20_ms_time_window upon transmission__irrespective of a flexible_bandwidth_scaling_factor N or chip rate divider Dcr in F-UMTS. The tools and techniques_provided may be implemented on mobile_devices and/or base_stations. Flexible bandwidths carriers may utilize_portions of spectrum that may be too big or too small to fit a normal_bandwidth_waveform for a normal_bandwidth_carrier.
