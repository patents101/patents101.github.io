A gateway_apparatus_including  a route_control_packet_generating_unit that generates a route_control_packet for constructing_routes between node_apparatuses_forming an ad_hoc_network and the gateway_apparatus  a channel_designation_signal_generating_unit that generates_channel_designation_signal for designating a second channel different from a first channel on which the ad_hoc_network_transmits and receives_packets  a time_designation_signal_generating_unit that generates_time_designation_signal for designating_switching_time to the node_apparatus for switching the channel used for transmission and reception of packets to the second channel  a radio_communication_unit that transmits the route_control_packet  the channel_designation_signal and the time_designation_signal on the first channel  and a channel_switching_unit that switches  when it is time to switch  the channel on which the radio_communication_unit_transmits and receives a signal to the second channel.
