A method of generating_network_identifiers for use by mobile_routers of a moving_network is provided which enables_fast and efficient_routing_loop_avoidance and detection. The method_comprises_receiving at a mobile_router of a sub-network_chain  a beacon from a preceding_mobile_router in the chain  the beacon containing a network_identifier of the preceding_mobile_router__generating a new network_identifier by applying a pre-defined_function to the received_network_identifier  and including the new network_identifier in beacons_broadcast by the receiving_mobile_router. When preparing for a handover  a mobile_router_compares the network_identifier_contained in a received_beacon with values_generated by applying said function against its own network_identifier. This allows the mobile_router to identify_beacons_originating from mobile_routers that are downstream in the same chain.
