A method of receiving a signal at a user equipment  UE  from at least two cells in wireless_communication_system is disclosed. Receiving module may receive_data and at least one reference_signal from a CoMP  Coordinated Multi-Point  set including at least two cells. Decoding module may decode the received_data and the received at least one reference_signal. In this case  a power_level of the data is same as a power_level of the at least one reference_signal  or a power_ratio between the data and the at least one reference_signal is a scaled value. Also  the power_level of the data and the at least one reference_signal are same for each of the at least two cells. A power_ratio between the data and the at least one reference_signal is a same scaled value for each of the at least two cells.
