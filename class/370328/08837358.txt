A method is disclosed that includes  for each of a multiplicity of subframes to be communicated using a first radio_access_technology__determining a first number of bits used for first feedback_information corresponding to a first communication_effected using the first radio_access_technology and a second number of bits used for second feedback_information corresponding to a second communication_effected using a second radio_access_technology. The method further includes  using only the first radio_access_technology__communicating the multiplicity of subframes  wherein for each of the multiplicity of subframes__included in the subframe are the first feedback_information using the determined first number of bits and the second feedback_information using the determined second number of bits. Apparatus  program products  and computer_programs are also disclosed.
