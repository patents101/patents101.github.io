A radio access network  RAN  includes a first wireless_access_point that radiates to define a first wireless_coverage_area  and a second wireless_access_point that radiates to define a second wireless_coverage_area. A dual-mode wireless communication device  WCD  capable of communicating via both the first and second wireless_coverage_areas_registers with the first wireless_access_point. As part of the registration_process  or at some point thereafter  the first wireless_access_point_transmits_information that identifies the second wireless_coverage_area. The first wireless_access_point also transmits a WCD identifier received from the WCD during the registration_process to the second access_point  so that the second access_point can add the WCD identifier to its whitelist. Thus  via the second wireless_coverage_area  the WCD can register with the second wireless_coverage_area.
