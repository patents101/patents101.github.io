A system and methodology that facilitates_service_continuity when a user equipment  UE  employing local breakout mechanisms at a femto access point  FAP  for a communication_session__moves out of the femto_coverage_area is provided. In particular  a network_change_detection_component can be employed to detect when the UE  attached to the FAP  changes its connection from the femto_network to the macro_network. Further  an active_communication_session can exist between the UE and a device/service/application on a local Area network  LAN  connected to a FAP  and/or the Internet  which utilizes_local_breakout at the FAP. When the UE moves out of the femto_network  a context_management_component can be employed to seamlessly_resume the communication_session  via the macro_network.
