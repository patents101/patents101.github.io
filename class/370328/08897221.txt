Space-division multiple access is optimally_realized while avoiding_inter-network_interference. Time usage information for transmission_sequence_units is exchanged among different networks or non-adjacent_equipment  and on the basis of this information  a station that initiates a transmission_sequence_unit_disposes the start_time of its own transmission_sequence_unit in a time_slot which is not being used by an adjacent_network or adjacent_equipment. As a result__multiple_wireless_networks or wireless_communication_devices are able to utilize a channel by time_division even in cases where exclusive_placement of frequency_channels is difficult  and efficient_space-division_multiple_access can be realized.
