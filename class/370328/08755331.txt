Determining the physical_location of a mobile_wireless_device. A computer_receives_1-hop and 2-hop_neighbor_information from a mobile_wireless_device for neighbor_devices of the mobile_wireless_device_responding to a discovery_request_transmitted by the mobile_wireless_device in an ad_hoc_wireless_communications_protocol. The computer_determines a physical_location of the mobile_wireless_device_based in part on stored_fixed_physical_locations of responding_devices  an area in which the mobile_wireless_device is in range of responding_1-hop_neighbors associated with a fixed_physical_location  and an area in which the mobile_wireless_device is in range of responding_1-hop_neighbors not associated with a fixed_physical_location  which are in the range of 2-hop_neighbors associated with fixed_physical_locations.
