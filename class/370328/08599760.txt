A scheme of error_decoupling for carrier_aggregation_techniques to support a communication_system is provided. The communication_system_operates with up to 2_codewords for up to 5_carriers  each codeword of each carrier having one acknowledgement/negative acknowledgement  ACK/NACK  or discontinuous transmission  DTX  to enable Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest  HARQ  to operate in each carrier. The scheme_involves the steps of  performing_separation of bits_related to ACK  NACK  DTX for each carrier using up to 2_codewords__determining a maximum_number of bits_related to ACK  NACK  DTX when decoupling is not performed after a maximum_number of carriers are used  and grouping the carriers such that separation between ACK  NACK  DTX of each carrier is optimized as long as the maximum_number of bits is not exceeded.
