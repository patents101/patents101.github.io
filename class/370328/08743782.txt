A user_initiates a request for determination of position of a mobile_device in an area where there is no GPS signal. The position of the mobile_device is determined by using cell_tower_triangulation_methods using the wireless_operator_network. If the mobile_device is in communication with a wireless_local_area_network_access_point  the mobile_device provides information about the address of the wireless_local_area_network_access_points within range and the signal_strength of the wireless_access_points. The server then stores the determined_position in a database in connection with each address and signal_strength_provided by the wireless_local_area_network_access_point. Thus the position of the wireless_local_area_network_access_point has now been recorded and can be used in the future to determine the position of a mobile_device.
