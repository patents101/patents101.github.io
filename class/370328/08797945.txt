A system and method a hybrid_scheme of mode_decision in a network having a plurality of mobile_stations_communicably_coupled to a base_station may include a mode_decision_module associated with the base_station. The mode_decision_module may include one or more processors_configured to select a first mode_configuration for use during transmission of a first communication from the base_station__receive first feedback_information_comprising a first mode_recommendation and first channel_information__identify a first system_state of the first communication_based at least in part on the first condition_information__determine whether to use the first mode_recommendation_configuration_based at least in part on the first system_state  and configure the second communication using a second mode_configuration_based on the determination.
