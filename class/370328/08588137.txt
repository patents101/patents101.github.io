The invention_relates to a telecommunications_network for wirelessly_establishing a connection with a terminal_located at a location in said network by a server. The terminal is identified by a terminal_identifier in the telecommunications_network. The telecommunications_network contains a first network_node and a second network_node. The first network_node is configured for receiving a data_unit for the terminal from the server  that is preferably_located outside the telecommunications_network. The data_unit_comprises the terminal_identifier. The first network_node is being configured for receiving a location_identifier_indicative of the location of the terminal from the server and for deriving an address of the second network_node using the location_identifier. The derived_address of the second network_node is then used for transmitting a first connection_request for establishing a connection with the derived second network_node.
