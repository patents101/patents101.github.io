Provided a method for simultaneously_transmitting_data_frames to a plurality of STAs in a multi-user_based_wireless_communication_system. The method includes  requesting_sounding or feedback for the plurality of STAs by using a first control_information_frame containing first group_information__receiving_responses to the sounding or feedback_request__reconfiguring the plurality of STAs composing the first group into a plurality of second groups on the basis of the responses such that the sum of maximum_transport_streams of the respective STAs composing one group becomes equal to or less than the maximum_number of streams_transmitted by an AP  transmitting a second control_information_frame containing second group_information on the respective second groups to the plurality of STAs composing the first group  and transmitting_data_frames by using the second group_information.
