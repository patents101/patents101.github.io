The present_invention_relates to a method of controlling_broadcasting in a wireless_sensor_network. The method includes performing_broadcasting from an upper_node to a lower_node for a predetermined_number of times__transmitting a time_offset_calculated according to the broadcasting from the lower_node to the upper_node__calculating an average of the time_offsets_received from at least one lower_node  by the upper_node and resetting the number of times of broadcasting according to the calculated_average by the upper_node. Accordingly  the number of times of broadcasting may be controlled according to the average of received_time_offsets in the wireless_sensor_network. In another aspect  an adjustment to the number of times of broadcasting may be received and the number of times of broadcasting may be adjusted_based on an average of the received_adjustments.
