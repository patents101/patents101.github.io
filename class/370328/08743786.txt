Teachings presented herein provide_reduced_computational_complexity and/or memory_requirements for a mobile_terminal to determine the power_backoff_required for a multi-carrier_uplink_signal. In particular  the mobile_terminal_determines whether its power_headroom_falls below a pre-defined_power_headroom_threshold__indicating that it is headroom_limited. If so  it quantizes_power_allocated to each carrier of the multi-carrier_uplink_signal according to a pre-defined_quantization_policy. In doing so  the mobile_terminal thereby reduces the possible configurations that may be selected for the multi-carrier_uplink_signal. Thus  in one embodiment  the mobile_terminal_stores the required_backoff in a look-up table for only the configurations that may be selected when the mobile_terminal is headroom_limited. This relieves the memory_requirements of the mobile_terminal as compared to storing the required_backoff for all possible configurations of the multi-carrier_uplink_signal.
