A method is provided in example embodiments that include receiving a radio_signal_stream and segmenting the radio_signal_stream into segments. The segments may be packetized and transported in packets over a pseudowire in a packet-switched_network. The radio_signal_stream can be reconstructed from the segments. In more particular embodiments  the pseudowire may be a multi-protocol_label_switching_pseudowire or a layer_2_tunneling_protocol_pseudowire  for example. In yet other specific example embodiments  the radio_signal_stream may be received using a common_public_radio_interface or a femtocell_application_programming_interface.
