Embodiments of the present_disclosure_disclose a data_transmission_method which includes  sending  by an REC  a first part of downlink_data of a downlink_period to an RE before the downlink_period_arrives__sending  by the REC  a second part of the downlink_data of the downlink_period to the RE in the downlink_period  where the second part and the first part_constitute all downlink_data of the downlink_period__receiving  by the RE  the first part and the second part of the downlink_data of the downlink_period  and sending  by the RE  the first part and the second part as the downlink_data through an air_interface in the downlink_period. Accordingly  the embodiments of the present_disclosure also disclose a base_station which can effectively_improve_utilization of transmission_bandwidth of a CPRI interface and utilization of spectrum_resources of the air_interface.
