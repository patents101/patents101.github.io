A method and apparatus for reducing_interference between systems when a plurality of wireless_access_systems are co-located are disclosed. To support CLC mode  an MS in the CRC mode transmits a handover_request_message to a first Base Station  BS  to initiate a handover_process__receives a handover_command_message_acknowledging the handover_request_message from the first BS  transmits a ranging_request_message to second BS at network_reentry after handover  and receives from the second BS a ranging response message including CRC start time information that set by the second BS.
