The invention_relates to a method for reducing_interference between users in a mobile_communications_network___1   in which uplink_transmissions from user equipment  UE   3   to a radio base station  RBS   5 A   5 B  can be performed on at least two different carriers  C 1   C 2  . The UE   3   support dynamic switching between CDM and TDM transmission mode and the RBS   5 A   5 B  is arranged to dynamically_set the mode of transmission for the UE   3  . The method_comprises the steps of     identifying  S 200   at least a first UE as a high data rate  HDR  UE currently requiring_high_data_transmission_rate__dedicating  S 201   at least one of said at least two carriers  C 1   C 2   to said HDR UE for at least a first period of time  T  said at least one carrier  C 1   C 2___hereinafter being named_clean_carrier  and   allocating  S 202   said at least first HDR UE to said clean_carrier  C 1   C 2   during said at least first period of time  T . This method_ensures that no UE operating in CDM mode is transmitting on the same carrier at the same time as the HDR UE.
