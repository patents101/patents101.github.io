Band steering for multi-band_wireless_clients. In a wireless_digital_network having at least one central_controller and a plurality of access_nodes_connected to the central_controller  and wherein some of the access_nodes_support a preferred_wireless_band and at least one non-preferred_wireless_band  the central_controller_identifies_wireless_client_devices_capable of multi-band_operation  and encourages them to connect to the preferred_wireless_band. Client devices may be identified as multi-band_capable by tracking_probe_requests. The central_controller keeps a list of multi-band_capable_clients  for example in a database. This information is provided to other central_controllers  and to access_nodes_attached to the central_controller. Multi-band capable clients are encouraged to connect on the preferred_wireless_band for example by having the access_nodes not respond to probe_requests on the non-preferred_wireless_bands. Connections made on the non-preferred_wireless_bands may be moved to the preferred_wireless_band.
