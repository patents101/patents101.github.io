A radio_relay_station_apparatus has a receiving_section_configured to receive a downlink_signal_including_relay_information as to whether or not a mobile_terminal_apparatus_performs_relay_transmission  a relay_amplification_factor_control_section_configured to control a relay_amplification_factor when performing the relay_transmission when the relay_information is information_indicating that the relay_transmission is performed  and a transmitting_section_configured to transmit an uplink_signal_amplified at the controlled_relay_amplification_factor. The relay_amplification_factor_control_section_controls the relay_amplification_factor so that a power_density of a signal from the mobile_terminal_apparatus_received at a radio_base_station_apparatus via the radio_relay_station_apparatus becomes substantially_equal to a case where the mobile_terminal_apparatus_exists at a position of the radio_relay_station_apparatus and performs_transmission without relay_transmission.
