An access_network  AN  receives a call_announcement_message for transmission to an access_terminal  AT . The AN initiates  in response to the received_call_announcement_message  a physical-layer_synchronization_procedure for at least one channel between the AN and the AT  the physical-layer_synchronization_procedure associated with a transition of the access_terminal to a dedicated_channel_state. The AN performs the initiation by sending a message to the AT. In response to the message  the AT monitors a downlink_channel for receipt of the call_announcement_message. The AN then transmits the call_announcement_message on the downlink_channel to the access_terminal  and the AT receives the call_announcement_message_due to the monitoring. The call_announcement_message is transmitted either  i  before the physical_layer_synchronization_procedure_completes or  ii  before a transmission of a reconfiguration_complete_message_indicating_completion of dedicated_channel_state_transition.
