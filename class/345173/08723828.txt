Provided is a touch_sensor-equipped_display_device that is not susceptible to the effect of noise_caused by the reversal of polarity of the common_voltage of the display_device  without using special_circuits. The touch_sensor-equipped_display_device includes  a touch_sensor_unit__7  having a plurality of sensor_electrodes  a sensor_output_read_circuit__21  that is sequentially_connected to the respective_sensor_electrodes and that outputs a signal_voltage corresponding to the electrical_characteristics of the sensor_electrode_connected_thereto  a sensor_control_circuit__23  that supplies a control_signal to the sensor_output_read_circuit__21   and a coordinate_calculation_circuit__22  that detects a contact_position on the basis of the signal_voltage. The coordinate_calculation_circuit__22  includes  an averaging_circuit__221  that calculates an average value for the signal_voltage_values_outputted from the sensor_output_read_circuit__21  over two cycles of the vertical_synchronizing_signal  and a contact_position_detection_circuit__222  that detects the contact_position on the basis of the average value.
