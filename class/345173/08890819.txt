A display_input_device includes a control_unit for correcting_horizontal_coordinates of an object to be detected on an xy_coordinate_plane_extending on a touch_panel__1   which are acquired by a proximity_sensor__12   according to an angle of elevation      an angle of deviation     and a vertical_distance z between the object to be detected and a surface of the touch_panel      being the angle of a straight_line OC with respect to the surface of the touch_panel  the straight_line OC extending between a predetermined_point O positioned on the touch_panel and a predetermined_point C positioned outside the touch_panel  and     being the angle between a straight_line which is an orthogonal_projection of the line OC onto the xy_coordinate_plane  and an x axis on the xy_coordinate_plane.
