A power_management_system for a touch_controller can include a transmit_section for transmitting_stimulation_signals to an associated touch_sensor_panel to drive the panel  where the touch_controller can selectively_adjust the transmit_section to reduce_power during the transmission. The touch_controller can also include a receive_section for receiving_touch_signals_resulting from the driving of the panel  where the touch_controller can selectively_adjust the receive_section to reduce_power during the receipt of the touch_signals. The touch_controller can also include a demodulation_section for demodulating the received_touch_signals to obtain_touch_event_results  where the touch_controller can selectively_adjust the demodulation_section to reduce_power during the demodulation of the touch_signals. The touch_controller can also selectively_reduce_power below present_low_levels during idle_periods. The touch_controller can be incorporated into a touch_sensitive_device.
