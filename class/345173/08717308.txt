A display_device with a touch_screen includes  first sensing_units  each first sensing_unit_comprising first optical_sensors_connected in series  each first sensing_unit_comprising a first terminal for receiving a first voltage  each first sensing_unit_extending in a first direction  second sensing_units  each second sensing_unit_comprising second optical_sensors_connected in series  each second sensing_unit_comprising a first terminal for receiving a second voltage  each second sensing_unit_extending in a second direction_transverse to the first direction  a reset_unit for applying a reset_voltage to a second terminal of each of the first and second sensing_units  and a read-out unit for sensing a touch_position_based on voltage changes at the second terminals of the first and second sensing_units.
