A display having data_lines that can be configured between a display_mode and a touch_mode is disclosed. The display can have sense_regions for sensing a touch or near touch on the display during the touch_mode. These same regions can display_graphics or data on the display during the display_mode. During display_mode  the data_lines in the sense_regions can be configured to couple to display_circuitry in order to receive_data_signals from the circuitry for displaying. During touch_mode  the data_lines in the sense_regions can be configured to couple to corresponding sense_lines in the regions  which in turn can couple to touch_circuitry  in order to transmit_touch_signals to the circuitry for sensing a touch or near touch. Alternatively  during touch_mode  the data_lines in the sense_regions can be configured to couple to ground in order to transmit_residual_data_signals to ground for discarding.
