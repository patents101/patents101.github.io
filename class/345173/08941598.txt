A driving_method_adapted to a touch-sensing_display_apparatus is provided. The touch-sensing_display_apparatus includes a display_panel and a touch_panel. The driving_method includes following steps. I scan_signals are sequentially sent to drive the display_panel to receive a plurality of data_signals. M driving_signals are sequentially sent to drive the touch_panel to generate a plurality of sensing_signals during a sensing_period. The m
