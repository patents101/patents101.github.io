A multi-touch_capacitive_touch_sensor_panel can be created using a substrate with column and row_traces_formed on separate_layers of the substrate. The column and row_traces can include sections_extending from a central_trace and forming a rectilinear_trace_pattern with sections of the columns and rows_interdigitated with one another. The trace_pattern can comprise a plurality of pixels_arranged_continuously across the sensor_panel. In this manner  the sensor_panel can provide a linear or near linear_response to touches across the touch_sensor_panel.
