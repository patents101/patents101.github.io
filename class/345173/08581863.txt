A liquid_crystal_display_panel in which coordinate_detection_electrodes are formed on a first substrate and protruding_contact_portions are formed on a second substrate as a touch_panel_function includes a conversion_circuit_formed therein. The conversion_circuit_subjects_information_indicative of whether the protruding_contact_portions are in contact with the coordinate_detection_electrodes to parallel/serial_conversion to output the converted_information to the coordinate_detection_circuit.
