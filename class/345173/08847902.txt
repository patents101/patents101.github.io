A touch_panel is disclosed. The touch_panel includes a substrate  a touch_sensing_array  a first pad_set  a second pad_set  several first traces  and several second traces. The touch_sensing_array  the first pad_set  the second pad_set  the first traces  and the second traces are disposed on the substrate. The first pad_set includes several first pads  and the second pad_set includes several second pads. The touch_sensing_array_locates between the first pad_set and the second pad_set  and the first pads and the second pads are in point_symmetric_arrangement with respective to the touch_sensing_array. The first traces are electrically_connected between the first pads and the touch_sensing_array  and the second traces are electrically_connected between the second pads and the touch_sensing_array.
