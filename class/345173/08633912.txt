The present_disclosure provides a method for making_touch_panel. An array of carbon_nanotubes  a substrate  and at least two electrodes are provided. The array of carbon_nanotubes is pressed via a pressing_device. A carbon_nanotube_structure is formed on a first surface of the substrate. The at least two electrodes and the carbon_nanotube_structure are electrically_connected and a touch_panel is formed.
