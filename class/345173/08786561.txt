An input_device has both a touch_sensor and a position_sensor. A computer using data from the input_device uses the relative_motion of a contact on a touch_sensor with respect to motion from a position_detector to disambiguate_intentional from incidental_motion. The input_device provides synchronized_position_sensor and touch_sensor_data to the computer to permit_processing the relative_motion and performing other computations on both position_sensor and touch_sensor_data. The input_device can encode the magnitude and direction of motion of the position_sensor and combines it with the touch_sensor_data from the same time_frame  and output the synchronized_data to the computer.
