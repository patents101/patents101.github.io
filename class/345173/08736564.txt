Methods and apparatus are provided_related to proximity_detection between a mobile_device and a related_object  such as a holder__holster__pocket_liner__support_surface  or the like. A pattern is associated with the related_object or device  for example printed on a surface_thereof  the pattern being discernable by a mobile_device_input_module  such as a touch_surface or optical_navigation_module. When the pattern is presented to the input_module  the mobile_device_detects the pattern and may respond accordingly  for example by shifting to a standby_mode or suppressing_mobile_device_inputs.
