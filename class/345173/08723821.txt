According to one embodiment  an electronic_apparatus includes a touch_screen_display  a first region_setup_module  a second region_setup_module  an operation_detection_module  a first data_output_module and a second data_output_module. The first region_setup_module_sets a first region_including_plural_input_regions on the touch_screen_display. The second region_setup_module_sets a second region_overlapped with the first region. The operation_detection_module_detects whether a touch_operation is a first operation or a second operation. The first data_output_module_outputs first data corresponding to a first potion of the first region where the touch_operation is performed  when the first operation is detected. The second data_output_module_outputs second data corresponding to a second position where the touch_operation is performed  when the second operation is detected.
