A user_input_device  a portable_electronic_device_including the user_input_device  and an operating_method_therefor__manages_multiple_modes of the user_input_device_based on detected_force and direction of tilt. The user_input_device includes a base_member with top_surface. A sensor_touchpad_module is disposed above the top_surface of the base_member. A plurality of pressure_sensors is disposed between the base_member and the sensor_touchpad_module. A processor_manages a set of user_input_modes_based on whether at least one of a first set of signals associated with a first user_input_mode and a second set of signals associated with a second user_input_mode has been detected.
