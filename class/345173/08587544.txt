There are provided an image_display_apparatus having a display_unit_capable of sensing a touch_made by a pointing_device  and a method for operating the same. The method includes outputting a synchronous_signal through the entire_region of the display_unit__transmitting a first scanning_signal and a second scanning_signal respectively scanning the display_unit in a first direction and a second direction to the pointing_device  and acquiring_touch_position_information regarding a touch_made by the pointing_device by using touch_time_information regarding time_points when the pointing_device_receives the first scanning_signal and the second scanning_signal after sensing the synchronous_signal. Accordingly  an error in touch_recognition_caused by the delay of a synchronous_signal can be minimized.
