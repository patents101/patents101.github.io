A low_power_driving and sensing_system for capacitive_touch_panels includes a capacitive_touch_panel  a first switch_device  a second switch_device  a driving_device  a sensing_device  and a control_device. The capacitive_touch_panel has plural first conductor_lines_arranged in a first direction and plural second conductor_lines_arranged in a second direction. The driving_device is connected to the first switch_device for driving the capacitive_touch_panel. The sensing_device is connected to the second switch_device for sensing the capacitive_touch_panel. The control_device_configures the first switch_device and the second switch_device for entering the capacitive_touch_panel into a self-capacitance_mode such that the driving_device and the sensing_device_perform a self capacitance_sensing  and into a mutual_capacitance_mode such that the driving_device and the sensing_device_perform a mutual_capacitance_sensing.
