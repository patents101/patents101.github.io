Disclosed herein is a digitizer_including  a driving_coil_supplied with current to induce a magnetic_line of force  a sensing_coil_disposed so as to intersect the driving_coil to flow_induced_current in one direction by the magnetic_line of force  and a control_unit_sensing_variation of voltage_induced to the sensing_coil to calculate_coordinates of the input_unit when the voltage is changed_due to an approach of an input_unit.
