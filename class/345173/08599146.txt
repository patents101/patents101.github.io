A liquid_crystal_device includes a liquid_crystal_panel  a plurality of detection_electrodes  a switching_circuit  and a position_identification_device. The liquid_crystal_panel is configured so that a liquid_crystal is sealed in a gap between a first substrate and a second substrate  which are opposed to each other  and a voltage of an opposite_electrode_opposite the liquid_crystal_periodically_varies. The plurality of detection_electrodes are provided on a side_opposite to a side on which the liquid_crystal is provided via the first substrate  wherein an initial_voltage is induced in each of the plurality of detection_electrodes on the basis of a variation in voltage of the opposite_electrode. The switching_circuit_sequentially_connects each of the plurality of detection_electrodes  in which the initial_voltages are induced  to a detection_portion. The position_identification_device_generates a position_signal that indicates a position of a pointing_body on the basis of a detection_signal_produced in the detection_portion.
