In one embodiment  a method for positioning a cursor_displayed on a touch-sensitive_display_screen is provided. The method may comprise_detecting a body_member_touching the touch-sensitive_display_screen and identifying an offset between the body_member and the cursor. Movement of the body_member_relative to the touch-sensitive_display_screen can also be detected. Upon detection of the movement  the cursor is also moved from the offset to match the movement of the body_member. The body_member may then be released and repositioned to a different position on the touch-sensitive_display_screen. Upon detection of the repositioning  a different offset between the body_member at the different position and the cursor is identified. Additional movement of the body_member after the detection of the reposition is detected and thereafter  the cursor is moved from the different offset to match the additional_movement of the body_member.
