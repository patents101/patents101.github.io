A method for classification_recognition of gestures and gesture_primitives in a touch-based_user_interface. In an implementation the method_comprises_receiving_tactile_image_data_responsive to data_generated from user_touch of a user_touch_interface_comprising a sensor_array. The tactile_image_data is processed to create a plurality of numerical_values_responsive to data_generated from the user_touch_interface. These numerical_values are applied to a principle_component_analysis_operation to produce a reduced-dimensionality_data_vector which is applied to a classifier having a plurality of classifier_outputs_interpretable as probabilities. The classifier_outputs_provide_likelihoods that an execution_gesture is from a collection of pre-defined_gestures  and a decision_test is used to produce a decision_output_indicating a gesture_outcome useful in user_interface_applications. The arrangement can recognize single finger    6D    actions of roll__pitch__yaw__left-right  forward-back  and variations in applied_pressure.
