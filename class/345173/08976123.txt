The display_device with high_detection_accuracy includes  display_pixel_electrodes  a common_electrode  a display_function_layer  a display_control_circuit_performing_image_display_control by applying a pixel_voltage to each of the display_pixel_electrodes and applying a common_drive_voltage to the common_electrode  the common_drive_voltage_inverting in synchronization with a drive_cycle of the image_display_control  a touch_detection_electrode_cooperating with the common_electrode to form a capacitor  and a touch_detection_circuit_detecting an external_proximity_object__based on a detection_signal_obtained from the touch_detection_electrode in response to the common_drive_voltage_applied to the common_electrode. The touch_detection_circuit_corrects the detection_signal_based on a gray_scale of the image_signal at the time of acquisition of the detection_signal  and performs the detection_operation.
