In a touch-sensing_structure for a touch_panel and a touch-sensing_method_thereof  the touch-sensing_structure includes a plurality of first conducting_wires_paralleled to each other and a first conductor. A terminal of each first conducting_wire is electrically_coupled to the first conductor  so as to divide the conductor into a plurality of first line_segments. The resistance of each first conducting_wire is smaller than that of each first line_segment. Wherein  when the displaying_area of the touch_panel_receives an external_force  a first conducting_wire corresponding to the position_designated by the external_force is electrically_coupled to a reference_potential.
