A system and method for operating a portable_electronic_device are disclosed. A detected_object is detected when the object is in contact with the device to provide_detection_results. Whether the device is performing a predetermined_function to provide a first determination_result and whether the object is in contact with the device_based on the detection_results to provide a second determination_result are then determined. One of a first function and a second function_comprising the first function_based on the first determination_result and the second determination_result is then selected. The first function is selected if it is determined that the device is performing the predetermined_function and that the object is in contact with mobile_terminal. The second function is selected if it is determined that the device is performing the predetermined_function and that the object is not in contact with the device.
