The present_invention_relates to an image_display_system with a touch_panel_sensing_device  which applied in an electronic_device  the touch_panel_sensing_device_including a substrate  a black_matrix  a first planarizing_layer  a conductive_metal__vertical and horizontal_electrode_layers  a second planarization  PLN  layer  and a color_resist_layer_disposed from top to bottom  wherein the vertical and horizontal_electrode_layers_disposed between the first planarizing_layer and the second PLN layer  therefore  by placing two perpendicularly_electrode_layers with the first planarizing_layer on the same side__effectively to avoid_chromatic_aberration and reduce the thickness of the touch_panel.
