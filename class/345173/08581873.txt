A tactile_interface includes a plurality of individually_controllable_drivers_positioned about a perimeter of a tensioned_elastomeric_material. Each driver includes a first electrode  a second electrode  and a piezoelectric_material. A top_surface of the first electrode is coupled to the tensioned_elastomeric_material. The piezoelectric_material is disposed between a top_surface of the second electrode and a bottom_surface of the first electrode. Driver circuitry can apply_control_information to each of the plurality of individually_controllable_drivers to produce a wave_pattern in the tensioned_elastomeric_material. Some example methods of providing a tactile_image on a tactile_interface include producing a time-varying_potential_difference across the top_electrode and the bottom_electrode of the drivers so that a standing_wave_pattern can be created in the elastomeric_material. The tactile_image can be formed by modulating a subset of the plurality of drivers.
