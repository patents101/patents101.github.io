A display_device include a display_unit that displays a display_image on a display_surface_based on image_data  a location_detection_unit that detects a pointed_location with respect to the display_image on the display_surface  a coordinate_calculation_unit that calculates first coordinates as coordinates of the pointed_location in a displayable_area within the display_surface  a coordinate_conversion_unit that converts the first coordinates_calculated by the coordinate_calculation_unit into second coordinates as coordinates in the image_data  and an output_unit that outputs the second coordinates_obtained by the coordinate_conversion_unit.
