An apparatus includes a memory and a processing_device_comprising_touch_sorting_logic. The touch_sorting_logic_sorts the raw_touch_position_data in two stages. In each of the stages  the touch_sorting_logic_predicts the centroid_positions for each touch of the plurality of touches__compares the predicted_centroid_positions for each touch and indexes the centroid_position for each touch_based on the predicted_centroid_position that is closest to the raw_touch_position_data. The sorted_touch_position_data is sorted according to the touch_index_assigned to each of the centroid_positions for each of the plurality of touches.
