A method and device for dual-differential_sensing is disclosed. The sensing_information can be generated from signals_provided by a sensing_device with a plurality of sensors. Each value of the sensing_information_corresponds to signals of three sensors  respectively. The sensing_device is flexible and configured on a display. The noise_effect of the display on the signal of each sensor_corresponds to the distance between the display and the sensor. Besides  the noise_effect of the display on each value of the sensing_information_corresponds to the distances between the display and the three sensors  respectively.
