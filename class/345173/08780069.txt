A computing_device with a touch_screen_display_simultaneously_displays on the touch_screen_display a plurality of user_interface_objects and at least one destination_object. The computing_device_detects a first input by a user on a destination_object_displayed on the touch_screen_display. While continuing to detect the first input by the user on the destination_object  the computing_device_detects a second input by the user on a first user_interface_object_displayed on the touch_screen_display. In response to detecting the second input by the user on the first user_interface_object  the computing_device_performs an action on the first user_interface_object. The action is associated with the destination_object.
