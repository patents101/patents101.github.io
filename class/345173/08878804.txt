An electronic_device includes a touch_panel having a first principal_surface and a second principal_surface_positioned_opposite to the first principal_surface  a light_shielding_film_formed on the first principal_surface of the touch_panel corresponding to a non-operation_area  and a vibrator_provided on the second principal_surface of the touch_panel corresponding to the non-operation_area. When a critical_angle where light is totally_reflected by the second principal_surface of the touch_panel is represented by     and sum of a thickness T 1  of the touch_panel and a thickness T 2  of the vibrator is represented by T  the vibrator is provided  on the second principal_surface of the touch_panel corresponding to the non-operation_area  at a position apart by T   tan     or more from an end of the light_shielding_film which end is positioned on the operation_area_side  in sectional_view.
