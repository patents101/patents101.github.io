A method for switching a touch_keyboard and a handheld_electronic_device and a storage_medium using the method are provided. The method is suitable for a handheld_electronic_device having a touch_screen. In the method  a character_input_function is first activated to display a first type_touch_keyboard on a side of the touch_screen. A touch_signal_produced within a display_area of the first type_touch_keyboard is then received and it is determined whether the touch_signal_moves to another side of the touch_screen. If the touch_signal is determined to move to the another side of the touch_screen  a second type_touch_keyboard is displayed on the another side of the touch_screen. Accordingly  the users can switch the touch_keyboard to another one conveniently so as to input_characters.
