A touch_pad includes a first transparent_substrate and a second transparent_substrate. The first transparent_substrate has a plurality of first axial_electrodes and at least one hollow_channel. The second transparent_substrate has a plurality of second axial_electrodes. Each of the second axial_electrodes has a plurality of first sensing_electrode_regions and at least one second sensing_electrode_region. The first sensing_electrode_regions are provided on both sides of the second sensing_electrode_region and arranged to extend along a second direction. The central_portion of the second sensing_electrode_regions is formed with a hollow_region. By means of the first axial_electrode and the second axial_electrode  the touch_pad of the present_invention has an increased_signal-to-noise_ratio and an enhanced_anti-jamming_capability.
