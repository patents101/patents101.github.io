A display_device and a display_method are provided in which the influence of the outside light can be removed_easily  in the case where light-emitting and light-receiving are performed in parallel and simultaneously. In the case where an image-display and a light-receiving are performed_simultaneously or alternately on a display_surface of the display_device__processing of making the display_surface_emit_light to display an image is performed__light_entering the display_surface is received  which is the light-receiving of two times of a state in which the light-emitting for display use is being performed__step S 11   and of a state in which light is not emitted__step S 12   and a state in which the display_surface is touched or approached is detected_based on the detection of a difference in the quantities of received_light of the two times__step S 13  .
