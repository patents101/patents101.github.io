A control_method of a mobile_terminal is disclosed. The control_method of a mobile_terminal includes  acquiring a pressure_signal through a pressure_sensing_module for sensing a change in pressure_applied to at least one part of the body in at least two degrees  and generating an event for changing a display_state of a display_unit through a control_signal to be matched to the pressure_signal. Emotional quality can be improved by changing a display_state of a display_unit in response to a change in pressure_applied to the body.
