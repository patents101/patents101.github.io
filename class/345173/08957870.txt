A noise_frequency_detection_method includes steps of  providing a frequency of system_clock__fixing an operation_frequency_band of a sensing_signal__adjusting a pulse_width of the sensing_signal and sampling a noise  wherein each pulse_width of the sensing_signal_corresponds to a noise value of the noise  and referring the pulse_width corresponding to a preset value of the noise to as a critical value  and obtaining a noise_frequency from dividing the frequency of system_clock by the critical value. A touch_apparatus is also provided.
