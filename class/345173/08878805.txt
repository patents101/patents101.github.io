An electronic_device includes a touch_panel  a light_shielding_film_formed on a first principal_surface of a touch_panel corresponding to a non-operation_area  and a vibrator_provided on a second principal_surface of the touch_panel corresponding to the non-operation_area. When a critical_angle at which light is totally_reflected by the second principal_surface of the touch_panel is     and sum of a thickness T 1  of the touch_panel and a thickness T 2  of the vibrator is T  the vibrator is positioned  in sectional_view  within a range of T   tan     from an end on the operation_area_side of the light_shielding_film on the second principal_surface of the touch_panel corresponding to the non-operation_area  and a reflection-reducing_film having a reflectance_lower than a reflectance of a surface of the vibrator is provided on the surface of the vibrator_positioned within the range of T   tan     from the end on the operation_area_side of the light_shielding_film.
