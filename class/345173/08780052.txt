The game_apparatus_executes a storage_step of repeatedly_acquiring_input_area_data_representing an input_area__41  in accordance with a detection_result from the input_device  and storing the input_area_data in a memory. Next  the game_apparatus_executes  a virtual_area_determination_step of determining a virtual_area__42  so as to follow a change of the input_area__41__represented by the input_area_data each time the input_area_data is stored in the memory  and a first process_execution_step of executing a first process  such as a process of moving a cursor  in accordance with the virtual_area__42  having been determined by the virtual_area_determination_step.
