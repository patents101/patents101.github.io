Embodiments of the present_invention may provide a device to adaptively_generate a haptic_effect. The device may include a controller to generate a haptic_command associated with a haptic_profile and a haptic_driver to generate a drive_signal_based on the haptic_command  wherein the drive_signal causes an actuator to produce_vibrations corresponding to a haptic_effect. Further  the device may include a sensor__coupled_mechanically to the actuator  to measure at least one property of the vibrations. The controller may adjust the haptic_command according to the measured at least one property. Therefore  the device may continuously_tune_haptic_effect_generation according to vibration_measurements.
