An apparatus in which an outer_conductive_ring_surrounds the periphery of a touch-sensitive_surface of a touch_sensor_serving as a manually-operable_control  wherein a portion of the outer_conductive_ring is also between the touch-sensitive_surface and another manually-operable_control that lacks the ability to sense the mere_touch of a tip of a digit of a user. A processing_device causes the level of capacitance of the outer_conductive_ring to be measured on a recurring_basis for instances of an amount of additional_capacitance above a minimum_capacitance_threshold  and employs such amounts of additional_capacitance in a comparison to distinguish between the user_interacting with a control_surface_defined on the touch-sensitive_surface of the touch_sensor or the other manually-operable_control.
