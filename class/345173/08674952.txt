A touch_display_panel which includes a first substrate  a second substrate  at least a multi-sensing_structure  a display_medium and at least a display_controlling_device is provided. The multi-sensing_structure is disposed between the first substrate and the second substrate  and the multi-sensing_structure includes a sensing_upper_electrode and a plurality of first sensing_lower_electrodes. The sensing_upper_electrode is disposed on the second substrate. The first sensing_lower_electrodes are disposed on the first substrate and electrically_connected to each other in series  wherein a plurality of first sensing_gaps are designed between the first sensing_lower_electrodes and the sensing_upper_electrode  and the first sensing_gaps have different distances. The display_medium is sandwiched between the first substrate and the second substrate. The display_controlling_device is disposed on the first substrate for controlling the display_medium.
