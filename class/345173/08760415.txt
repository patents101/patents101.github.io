This disclosure_features an electronic_display with overlayed_electronic_skin. The display includes an outer_transparent_display_surface and can be placed in a dark_state or in a bright_state. The skin_overlays the outer_display_surface and includes an electro-optic_layer. Transparent electrically conductive layers are disposed on each side of the electro-optic_layer. Electronic circuitry applies voltages to the electrically_conductive_layers_enabling the electro-optic_material of the electronic_skin to be placed into a substantially_transparent_state and a reflective_state. Images or colors can be displayed on the electronic_skin while portions of the electronic_skin are in the reflective_state and light_passing through the electronic_skin is absorbed by the display in the dark_state. When the display is in the bright_state_images or colors can be displayed on the display that can be seen through the electronic_skin.
