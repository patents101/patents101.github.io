The present_invention_discloses a touch-sensing_method__applied to a touch-sensing_circuit  wherein the touch-sensing_circuit includes a detection_circuit and a comparison_circuit. The touch-sensing_method includes  enabling a receiving_node to be coupled to a ground during a first discharge_period  wherein the receiving_node is coupled between the detection_circuit and the comparison_circuit__enabling the receiving_node to obtain a first reference_voltage during a first charge_period__enabling the receiving_node to be coupled to the ground during a second discharge_period  and enabling the receiving_node to obtain a second reference_voltage and producing a sensing_result according to the first reference_voltage and the second reference_voltage by the comparison_circuit during a second charge_period  wherein the sensing_result_represents whether a touch_event_occurs at a first node of the touch-sensing_circuit.
