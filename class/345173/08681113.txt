An all-in-one computer_system_comprising  a base_panel having a top_surface and a bottom_surface  and a screen_panel_coupled to and extending from the base_panel  the screen_panel_comprising a screen. In some embodiments  a speaker_system is coupled to the bottom_surface of the base_panel to provide a stand on which the base_panel can be supported at an angle with respect to a resting_surface  wherein the speaker_system is configured to be adjusted along the bottom_surface of the base_panel to adjust the angle at which the base_panel is supported. In some embodiments  a processing_unit is communicatively_coupled to the tilt_sensor and to the screen  wherein the processing_unit is configured to switch the screen between a touch_mode and a non-touch_mode_based on the angle_sensed by the tilt_sensor.
