A mobile_terminal and controlling_method_thereof are disclosed  which facilitates a terminal to be used in further consideration of user s convenience. According to at least one of embodiments of the present_invention  while a first function is being executed in a mobile_terminal  if a second function different from the first function is executed  a first function_icon having execution_progress_status_information of the first function at a timing_point of stopping the execution of the first function can be generated. If the first function is re-executed by selecting the first function_icon later  it is advantageous in that the first function can be executed in a manner of being continuous with an execution_progress_status at the execution_stop_timing_point.
