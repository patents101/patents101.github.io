A touch_screen_panel according to an exemplary_embodiment of the present_invention includes  first and second substrates each being divided into a touch_active_region and a touch_non-active_region that is located outside the touch_active_region  second sensing_electrodes at the touch_active_region on a first surface of the first substrate  first sensing_electrodes_divided into at least two groups respectively at the touch_active_regions on different surfaces of the first and second substrates  a group of the at least two groups being on a second surface of the first substrate or at least one surface of the second substrate  and outside wirings_connected to the first and second sensing_electrodes  the outside wirings and the sensing_electrodes on a same one of the substrates being at a same plane.
