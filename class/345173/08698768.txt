A touch_screen_panel_comprises a first sensing_pattern_provided with first sensing_cells_arranged on one row along a first direction on a transparent_substrate  and a first connection_pattern through which adjacent first sensing_cells are electrically_connected to each other. A second sensing_pattern is provided with second sensing_cells_arranged so as to be spaced apart from the first sensing_cells on one column along a second direction on the transparent_substrate  and a second connection_pattern through which adjacent second sensing_cells are electrically_connected to each other. The first connection_pattern includes at least two pairs of metal_patterns_arranged so as to be spaced apart from one another  and a transparent_pattern_formed in the shape of an island in the second sensing_pattern so as to be electrically_connected to one or the other end of each of the metal_patterns.
