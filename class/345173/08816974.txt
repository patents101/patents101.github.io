Systems and methods for smudge_control for touch_screen_human_interface_devices are provided. In one embodiment  a touch_screen_human_interface_device_comprises  a touch_sensitive_display_surface  the touch_sensitive_display_surface_including a first region having a first surface_energy with respect to a contaminant_material  and a pattern of a plurality of nucleation_sites_distributed within the first region  wherein each of the plurality of nucleation_sites_possesses a second surface_energy that is higher than the first surface_energy with respect to the contaminant_material.
