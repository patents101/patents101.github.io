Multi-axis navigation techniques are described. In implementations  a user_interface is output by a computing_device  the user_interface includes a first axis and a second axis that include parameters that are navigable via one or more gestures. One or more items are chosen by the computing_device for concurrent_display with the first and second axes that correspond to a first one of the parameters of the first axis and a second one of the parameters of the second axis.
