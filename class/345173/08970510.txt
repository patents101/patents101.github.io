The present_invention_relates to an embedded_touch_sensitive_display  which includes a liquid crystal display  LCD  a touch_sensing_layer  a touch_signal_transfer_circuit and a conductive_media. The liquid_crystal_display_comprises a top_substrate  a bottom_substrate  and a liquid_crystal_layer which is configured between the top_substrate and the bottom_substrate. The touch_sensing_layer is disposed below the top_substrate of the LCD for generating_touch_signals after sensing an outside touch_action  and the touch_signal_transfer_circuit is disposed above the bottom_substrate of the LCD. The conductive_media is disposed between the touch_sensing_layer and the touch_signal_transfer_circuit for transferring the touch_signals between the touch_sensing_layer and the touch_signal_transfer_circuit.
