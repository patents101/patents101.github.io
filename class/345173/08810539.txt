A touch_input_device with a button_function is provided. The touch_input_device includes a touch_module  a triggering_switch  a coupling_module  and plural_movable_pads. The plural_movable_pads are disposed on the coupling_module. The coupling_module is disposed on the touch_module. In addition  the coupling_module may be swung_relative to the touch_module. When the touch_module is depressed  the coupling_module is pushed by the plural_movable_pads. Consequently  the coupling_module is swung to push the triggering_switch that is disposed over the coupling_module. Since the plural_movable_pads are directly_disposed on the coupling_module  the force to push the triggering_switch is directly_transmitted from the plural_movable_pads to the coupling_module. Under this circumstance  the touch_input_device can provide an enhanced_tactile_feel to the user.
