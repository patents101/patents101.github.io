A manually_operated_operation_apparatus that is combined with a display_apparatus for showing a different image for respectively different occupants includes a driver_sensor at a position being touched by a driver who operates an operation_unit  a passenger_sensor at another position being touched by a passenger who operates the operation_unit. Based on a detection_result of these sensors  the operator of the operation_unit is determined. In this manner  the operation_apparatus_distinguishes the operator of the operation_unit for removing a limitation on an operation_icon being displayed on the display_apparatus without imposing a special_operation on a user  thereby enabling an improvement of the usability of the operation_apparatus.
