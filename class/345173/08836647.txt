A touch_sensor has a support_layer___12   of an insulating_material and a resistive_layer___13___applied to the support_layer. A resistive_material is shaped according to an elongated_pattern_forming a sequence of touch_positions  and has a single_terminal___16   to be coupled to a sense_input___17   of a detecting_device___11   while an open_end___15   of the sequence_opposite to the terminal_end_remains_unconnected. The detecting_device_detects an active_resistance  R p   between the single_terminal and one of said touch_positions that is touched by a user via a return_capacitance_constituted  C u   by the user and a mass_element___18___coupled to the detecting_device. Advantageously only a single_terminal is necessary  whereas a number of touch_positions can be discriminated.
