A liquid_crystal_display_device includes a liquid_crystal_panel_comprising a first substrate and a second substrate  a seal_pattern_arranged in the edge_provided between the first and second substrates  and a liquid_crystal_layer  a plurality of first electrodes and second electrodes_crossing each other and arranged in the seal_pattern on an outer_surface of the second substrate  a pad_electrode for the touch_panel_partially_overlapping the seal_pattern on the outer_surface of the second substrate  a pad_electrode for the liquid_crystal_panel_arranged at the outside of the seal_pattern on the first substrate  a chip-on-film  COF  connected to the pad_electrode for the liquid_crystal_panel  a printed_circuit_board for driving the liquid_crystal_panel__connected to the chip-on-film  a routing_line to connect the pad_electrode for the touch_panel to the first electrodes and the second electrodes on the outer_surface of the second substrate  and a flexible_printed_cable_connected to pad_electrodes for the touch_panel  to receive_driving_signals of the first and second electrodes  the flexible_printed_cable_connected to the printed_circuit_board.
