A method and apparatus for interpreting_multi-touch_events on a computing_device_comprising_creating a reference_coordinate_system using first two touch_points A and B on the device__creating a modified_coordinate_system using second two touch_points C and D on the device__determining a reference_origin_point  O  for the reference_coordinate_system where a first angle is formed by the points AOB as a right angle and determining a modified_origin_point  O     for the modified_coordinate_system where a second angle is formed by points CO   D as a right angle  and calculating a transformation_matrix T between the reference_coordinate_system and the modified_coordinate_system.
