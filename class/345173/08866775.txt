The present_disclosure_relates to an input_interface and particularly to a novel touch_panel which includes a plurality of first axial_electrodes and a plurality of second axial_electrodes. Each of the first axial_electrodes is extended in a first direction. Each of the first axial_electrodes includes a plurality of first inductive_electrodes  a plurality of second inductive_electrodes  and a plurality of first connecting_lines. The first inductive_electrodes and the second inductive_electrodes are disposed_alternatively along a first direction. Each of the first connecting_lines is disposed between the first inductive_electrodes and the second inductive_electrodes. Each of the second axial_electrodes is extended in a second direction. Each of the second axial_electrodes has a plurality of hollow_areas_arranged along the second direction  and each of the first inductive_electrodes is disposed within said hollow_areas.
