A touch_pad for a data_processing_system that includes a first film and an electrically_conductive first thin_film above the first film  a plurality of electrically_non-conductive_spacer_dots above the first thin_film  a second electrically_conductive_thin_film above the plurality of spacer_dots  and a second film above the second thin_film. The density of spacer_dots above the first thin_film is non-uniform. In one implementation  the first film is a ceramic  the second film is a flexible_polymer  and the first and second thin_films are a metal-oxide_compound. In one embodiment  the spacer_dot_density is in a first range over a first portion of the first film and in a second range over a second portion of the first film. The second portion of the first film may define a signature_box_suitable for receiving a user s signature.
