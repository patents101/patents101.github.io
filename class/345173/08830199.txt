An in-vehicle_apparatus includes an LCD that displays an operation_screen  an operation_position_detector that detects a position that is part of the operation_screen_displayed on the LCD and that is touched by a user with an operation_force_larger than or equal to an operation_determination_threshold value with a touch_panel on a certain detection_cycle  a connection_determiner that determines whether a mobile_terminal_apparatus is connected to the in-vehicle_apparatus  and an operation_determination_threshold value changer that changes the operation_determination_threshold value to a value corresponding to the connected_mobile_terminal_apparatus if the connection_determiner_determines that the mobile_terminal_apparatus is connected to the in-vehicle_apparatus.
