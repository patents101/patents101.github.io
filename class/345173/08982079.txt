An electronic_device is provided__including a housing  at least one tap_sensing_unit and a processing_unit. The housing has a touch_surface  in which  when the touch_surface is tapped more than one time in a predetermined_interval__shock_waves are generated. The tap_sensing_unit_receives the shock_waves to generate a moire_signal. The processing_unit_obtains a shock_wave_source_number of each of the shock_waves according to the moire_signal  and generates a string_code according to a generation_order of the shock_waves and the shock_wave_source_number of each of the shock_waves  such that the processing_unit_controls the electronic_device according to a control_command corresponding to the string_code.
