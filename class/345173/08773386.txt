A method and apparatus_perform a first scan of an input_device and determine that a first signal_profile_received through the first scan is outside a range of a reference_signal_profile. The method and apparatus_perform a second scan of the input_device_responsive to the first signal_profile being outside the range of the reference_signal_profile and use a second signal_profile_received through the second scan to detect a presence of an input_object at least proximate to the input_device.
