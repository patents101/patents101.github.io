An instrument and method for operating the same is disclosed. The instrument includes an input_port for receiving a signal  a processor for measuring a first parameter_related to the signal  and a touch-enabled_display. The touch-enabled_display_receives_commands_directed to the processor and displays the first parameter. The commands_including_commands that determine how the first parameter is displayed and commands that determine the manner in which the instrument_operates. The commands are grouped into a plurality of contexts. Each command in a context is specified by a control_gesture on the touch-enabled_display. A first control_gesture is used for a first command in a first context  the first control_gesture is also utilized for a second command in a second context  the first context being different from the second context.
