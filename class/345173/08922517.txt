A method for detecting_touch_spots of a touch_panel. In the detecting_process  a pulse_signal is input into each of a plurality of first driving-sensing_electrodes  thereby simulating an R1n C curve for computing a coordinate of the touch_spots  at the high_impedance_direction. A pulse_signal is input into each of a plurality of second driving-sensing_electrodes  thereby simulating an R 2n C curve. The coordinate of the touch_spots  at a low_impedance_direction can be computed by the R 1n C curve and the R 2n C curve.
