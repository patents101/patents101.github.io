A capacitive_position_sensor has a two-layer_electrode_structure. Drive electrodes extending in a first direction on a first plane on one side of a substrate. Sense electrodes extend in a second direction on a second plane on the other side of the substrate so that the sense_electrodes_cross the drive_electrodes at a plurality of intersections which collectively_form a position_sensing_array. The sense_electrodes are provided with branches_extending in the first direction_part of the way towards each adjacent_sense_electrode so that end_portions of the branches of adjacent_sense_electrodes_co-extend with each other in the first direction_separated by a distance_sufficiently_small that capacitive_coupling to the drive_electrode_adjacent to the co-extending_portion is reduced. Providing sense_electrode_branches allow a sensor to be made which has a greater_extent in the first direction for a given number of sense_channels  since the co-extending_portions_provide an interpolating_effect. The number of sense_electrode_branches per drive_electrode can be increased which allows a sensor to be made which has ever greater_extent in the first direction without having to increase the number of sense_channels.
