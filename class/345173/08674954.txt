A method of manufacturing an organic_light_emitting_diode_display includes forming an organic_layer on a support__forming a touch_sensor on the organic_layer  the touch_sensor_including a touch_electrode_pattern and a polarizing_layer__separating the touch_sensor from the support by removing the organic_layer  and attaching the touch_sensor to an organic_light_emitting_diode_display_panel.
