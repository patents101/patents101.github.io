A proximity-aware_multi-touch_tabletop is disclosed that includes both a touch_screen_display and proximity_sensors. The proximity_sensors are disposed in one or more annular_groups around the touch_screen_display and are positioned in upward- and outward-facing_directions. The proximity_sensors allow the multi-touch_tabletop to sense the distance of a body__arm__hand  or fingers of a user from the multi-touch_tabletop. Thus  hand__arm  and finger_positions of a user can be determined_relative to the body_position of the user  which enables the multi-touch_tabletop to differentiate between left_hand/arm_gestures and right hand/arm_gestures. Further  because the multi-touch_tabletop can correlate_left_arm and right arm_movements to a user_body  the multi-touch_tabletop can differentiate_gestures_originating from different users. The ability of the multi-touch_tabletop to distinguish between users_greatly_enhances_user_experiences  particularly in a multi-user_environment.
