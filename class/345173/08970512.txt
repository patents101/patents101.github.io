A touch_screen_display_device is described that includes a display_panel  a display_driver  a sensor_circuit and a combination_unit. The display_panel has a plurality of display_elements_arranged between a first and a second electrode_layer. The display_driver is arranged for providing display_signals_comprising a common_display_signal and an input_control_signal to the display_panel. The sensor_circuit is arranged for providing a probe_signal and a shield_signal_mutually having the same phase and frequency and for generating a touch_signal in response to the output_signal_received from the first electrode_layer. The combination_unit provides a drive_signal to the first electrode_layer_derived from the common_display_signal and the probe_signal  and further provides an output_control_signal for the display_panel from the input_control_signal and the shield_signal.
