There are provided an electronic_apparatus and an operating_method_thereof. The electronic_apparatus includes  at least one mechanical_button_unit_receiving a mechanical_button_input from a user  a touch_screen_receiving a touch_input from the user  and a control_unit_detecting a first input_signal_generated from the at least one mechanical_button_unit to generate a first control_signal and detecting a second input_signal_generated from the touch_screen to generate a second control_signal  wherein the control_unit_generates a third control_signal different from the first control_signal when the first input_signal and the second input_signal are simultaneously_detected.
