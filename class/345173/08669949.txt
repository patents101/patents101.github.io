An apparatus having a touch_sensor able to detect the touch of a tip of a digit of a user  having a conductive_ring able to detect the approach of the tip towards the touch_sensor  having a motion_sensor to sense_movement of a casing the apparatus  and having components of a controller to place the apparatus in one of a lower_power_mode after a predetermined_period of inactivity has elapsed  a partial_power_mode in response to an indication of the approach of a tip of a digit  and a higher_power_state to detect_touching of the touch_sensor by a tip of a digit. Other forms of proximity_detectors may be employed in place of the conductive_ring  or the conductive_ring may be replaced by one or more elongate_conductors_positioned about one or more sides of the periphery of a touch-sensitive_surface of the touch_sensor.
