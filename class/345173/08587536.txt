The disclosure is related to a touch_panel with a micro-electrode_matrix. It is formed by a plurality of x-axis_scanning_line  a plurality of y-axis_scanning_line and a micro-electrode_matrix_defined by each of the scanning_lines  wherein the micro-electrode_matrix is formed by the plurality of micro-electrode_series in x-axis_connected to the scanning_line in x-axis and the plurality of micro-electrode_series in y-axis_connected to the scanning_line in y-axis. Each of the micro-electrode_chains is composed by the plurality of micro-electrode and series_resistances.
