A touch_position_calculation_unit__113__calculating the touch_position_based on detected_intensities at a touch_panel_unit__150__compares the detected_intensities with a threshold to determine whether the touch is valid. Here  since display_noise_caused by the display_screen of a display_unit__132__affects the touch_detection  the touch_position_calculation_unit__113__acquires the display_state of the display_unit__132  from a display_control_unit__112 . The touch_position_calculation_unit__113__makes_reference to a condition_list_stored in a memory__160  and sets up a threshold corresponding to the display_state as the touch_detection_condition. Information indicating the display_state includes the screen_design_typified by coloration_patterns and the total_gradation value corresponding to the voltage_applied to the screen.
