A signal_conversion_control_circuit_comprises an analog-to-digital_converter  a first sample-and-hold_circuit  a second sample-and-hold_circuit  a first switch  a second switch  a third switch  and a fourth_switch. The analog-to-digital_converter has an input_end for receiving an output_signal of a touch_screen. The first sample-and-hold_circuit is configured to provide the analog-to-digital_converter with a high-level_reference_voltage. The second sample-and-hold_circuit is configured to provide the analog-to-digital_converter with a low-level_reference_voltage. The first switch_connects a supplied_voltage to the touch_screen. The second switch_connects the touch_screen to a ground_potential. The third switch_connects the supplied_voltage to the first sample-and-hold_circuit through the first switch. The fourth_switch_connects the ground_potential to the second sample-and-hold_circuit through the second switch.
