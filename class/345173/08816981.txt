 Object  It is an object to provide a mount_structure of a touch_panel with a vibration_function which is superior in impact_resistance__dust-proofness  and drip-proofness  and can effectively_transmit a vibration of a vibration_element.  Solution to Problem  The mount_structure of the touch_panel with the vibration_function is characterized by including a touch_panel_body  a design_sheet_bonded to an upper_surface of the touch_panel_body and having a transparent_window_part and a decorative_part_surrounding the transparent_window_part  a vibration_element_formed in a back_surface_peripheral_part of the touch_panel_body and hidden by the decorative_part  a casing_dented so as to have a level_difference to allow the above parts to be externally_fitted in and having a recess_part or an opening_part for a display_device  and a frame-shaped_support_part to support the back_surface_peripheral_part of the touch_panel_body  in its bottom_surface  an elastic_member_frame_arranged on the support_part and positioned on an outer_edge_side of the touch_panel with respect to the vibrator  and a vibration_control_unit_arranged_inside the casing to apply a drive_voltage to the vibration_element.
