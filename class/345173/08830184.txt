Disclosed is an image_displaying_device_including a first touch_panel_arranged on a display_screen and generating first coordinate_information_representing a first coordinate_pair_denoting the location of a touch on the panel_surface  a second touch_panel_arranged at the rear of the display_screen and generating second coordinate_information_representing a second coordinate_pair_denoting the location of a touch on the panel_surface  and a control_unit_detecting_concurrent_touches on the surfaces of the first and second touch_panels and  if the concurrent_touches are detected__detecting_coordinate_pairs_overlapping between the first coordinate_pairs and the second coordinate_pairs to determine whether or not the overlapping_coordinate_pairs_exist in a number not lower than specified. A method of and a program for displaying an image on such an image_displaying_device are also disclosed.
