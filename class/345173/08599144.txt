A touch-sensing_device has a top and a bottom_surface. A grounded_connector is coupled to the bottom_surface of the touch-sensing_device and extends through the touch-sensing_device to the top_surface of the touch-sensing_device. The touch-sensing_device has a grounded_layer. A first dielectric_layer is on the grounded_layer. A conductive_layer of the touch-sensing_device has an opening. The conductive_layer is on the first dielectric_layer. The second dielectric_layer is on the conductive_layer. The grounded_connector is coupled to the grounded_layer and extends through the opening of the conductive_layer to the top_surface of the second dielectric_layer.
