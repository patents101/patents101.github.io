The present_invention provides a time-reversal-based_impact-localization and haptic-feedback_method for touch_panels. Firstly  a plate_model for an elastic_plate and the impulse_responses_thereof are constructed according a plate_theory. Next  a mathematical_model is established according to the impulse_responses and a time-reversal_approach. When an impact_force_hits the elastic_plate  the touched_point on the elastic_plate_generates a touch_signal  and the touch_signal is received by at least a sensor at the corner of the elastic_plate. The touch_signal is converted into a time-reversal_signal according to the mathematical_model by a simulator. The time-reversal_signal is reversed to the touched_point for simulating_reversal_vibration_waves of the time-reversal_signal on the elastic_plate  and locating the touched_point.
