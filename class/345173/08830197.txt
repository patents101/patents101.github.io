An electronic_device includes a front_panel_made of resin. The front_panel is disposed on the front_side of an organic_electroluminescent_display_panel and functions as the front_surface of the electronic_device  and an adhesive_agent_layer_formed between the organic_electroluminescent_display_panel and the front_panel. The organic_electroluminescent_display_panel is fixed to the front_panel via the adhesive_agent_layer. This structure is able to reduce a load_applied to the organic_electroluminescent_display_panel and ensure_shock_resistance for the organic_electroluminescent_display_panel.
