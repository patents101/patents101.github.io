A touch_tracking_method for the touch_screen is provided. A touch_tracking_method for a touch_track on a touch_screen_comprises the steps of  defining a touch_track_function by information of detected_touch_points__calculating a predicted_touch_point by said touch_track_function__determining if a next detected_touch_point is located in a preset_scope of said predicted_touch_point  and if the next detected_touch_point is located in the preset_scope of the predicted_touch_point__outputting the predicted_touch_point as an output_touch_point. A touch_tracking_device for a touch_track on a touch_screen is also provided. The touch_tracking_device for the touch_screen can  not only determine_relationship between detected_touch_points at different detected_times to draw the touch_tracks  but can also make the touch_track_smooth and help eliminate_noise_point_effectively.
