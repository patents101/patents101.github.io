This document_describes_tools associated with symbol_entry_control_functions. In some implementations  the tools_identify a first finger that is in tactile_contact with a touch_screen. The first finger can select a subset of symbols from a plurality of symbols that can be entered via the touch_screen. The tools can also identify whether one or more other fingers are in concurrent_tactile_contact with the first finger on the touch_screen. The tools can select an individual_symbol from the subset_based on whether the one or more other fingers are in concurrent_tactile_contact with the first finger on the touch_screen.
