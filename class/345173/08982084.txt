A device_implements a method of tracking_objects on a touch_surface of an FTIR based touch-sensitive apparatus. The method_repeatedly_operates to generate an interaction_pattern that indicates local changes in interaction on the touch_surface__identify_apparent_peaks in the interaction_pattern  and update_existing_movement_trajectories_based on the apparent_peaks. An error_suppression_process is executed at least intermittently in the method to process the apparent_peaks and/or the existing_movement_trajectories to identify_implicated_trajectories with a potential_tracking_problem__define two or more movement_propositions for each implicated_trajectory  and cause an evaluation of the movement_propositions in one or more subsequent_repetitions of the method. The error_suppression_process_improves_tracking by postponing the final_decision on how to track the object of the implicated_trajectory until more information is available.
