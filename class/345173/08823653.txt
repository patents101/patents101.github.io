A capacitive_input_device includes a translucent_substrate  first translucent_electrode_lines__extending in a first direction  second translucent_electrode_lines__extending in a second direction_intersecting with the first direction__interlayer_insulating_layers  and relay_electrodes. The first translucent_electrode_lines_intersect with the second translucent_electrode_lines at intersecting_portions. Portions of one of each first translucent_electrode_line and each second translucent_electrode_line are connected to each other with the intersecting_portions. Portions of the other are separated from each other with the intersecting_portions. The translucent_interlayer_insulating_layers_overlie the first or second translucent_electrode_line_portions_connected to each other with the intersecting_portions. The translucent_relay_electrodes_overlie the interlayer_insulating_layers to electrically_connect the first or second translucent_electrode_line_portions__separated from each other with the intersecting_portions  to each other.
