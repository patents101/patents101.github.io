Devices and methods for minimizing a number of I/O pins_needed to control LED and touch_sense_operations are described and disclosed herein. In an embodiment  a method_comprises_controlling at least one light emitting diode  LED  element via a single_pin  and controlling at least one touch_sense_element via the single_pin. In an embodiment  a touch-sensitive light emitting diode  LED  display device comprises at least one LED element  at least one touch_sense_element  and a controller_integrated in an integrated circuit  IC  and coupled to the at least one LED element and the at least one touch_sense_element via a single_pin. The controller is configured to communicate via the pin with the at least one LED element and the at least one touch_sense_element.
