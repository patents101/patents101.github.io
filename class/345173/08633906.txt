An operation_control_apparatus is provided which includes a detection_unit for detecting_contact of an operation_tool with a display_surface of a display_unit  a contact_determination_unit for determining a contact_state of the operation_tool with the display_surface_based on the detection_result by the detection_unit  a contact_area_recognition_unit for recognizing  in the case where it is determined by the contact_determination_unit that the operation_tool is in contact with the display_surface  a contact_area where the operation_tool is in contact with the display_surface  and an operation_determination_unit for determining  from a plurality of operation_processing associated with an act of the operation_tool in contact with the display_surface  an operation_processing to be executed__based on a size of the contact_area_recognized by the contact_area_recognition_unit.
