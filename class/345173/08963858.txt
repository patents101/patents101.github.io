An apparatus and method for the use of a resistive_touch_screen as a proximity_sensor. The touch_screen_operates in a touch_sensing_mode and a proximity_sensing_mode. The proximity_sensing_mode_turns off the touch_sensing_circuit and uses the equivalent_capacitor_formed by the top_layer of the touch_screen with a nearby_object to detect_proximity. A control_circuit_selectively_connects the touch_screen with measurement_circuits to perform each of the sensing_functions. The control_circuit can be implemented with timing_based_control or an event_driven_topology.
