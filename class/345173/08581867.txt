A touch_sensor_device is provided. The touch_sensor_device includes a touch_panel_including a plurality of touch_mark-keys_indicating a position_touched by a touch_object  a plurality of first touch_pads_disposed at positions corresponding to the plurality of touch_mark-keys of the touch_panel and generating_touch_information of the touch_object as a first electrical_signal  a plurality of second touch_pads_disposed between the plurality of first touch_pads and generating_touch_information of a conductive_material on the touch_object as a second electrical_signal  and a touch_sensing_unit_receiving the first electrical_signal__outputting a plurality of sensing_signals to allow an electronic_device to perform_predetermined_operations corresponding to the touched_touch_mark-keys  and determining whether the touch of the touch_object is a normal one using the first and second electrical_signals.
