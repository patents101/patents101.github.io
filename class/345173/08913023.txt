A touch_control_method used for an electronic_device_storing a relationship_table_recording a mapping_relationship between handwritten_touch_input and a number of commands includes the following steps. Display an electronic_file. Sense a touch_trace of a user on the displayed_electronic_file and generating a trigger_signal if the touch_trace_forms a closed_loop having an enclosed_region. Sense handwritten_touch_input by the user within the enclosed_region and generate associated signals. Recognize a circled_path having an enclosed_region as input by the user according to the generated_signals. Determine a command associated with the sensed_handwritten_touch_input according to the relationship_table in response to the trigger_signal. Retrieve content of the displayed_electronic_file_displayed within the enclosed_region. And execute the retrieved_command to the retrieved_content. An electronic_device using the method is also provided.
