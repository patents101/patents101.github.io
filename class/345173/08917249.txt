An interference_suppression_module_coordinates_devices_susceptible to interference such as a touch_sensor with potentially_interference_generating_devices such as a display_drive_matrix  an active_haptic_device  and so forth. As a result of status_signals_generated by the interference_suppression_module__controllers of the susceptible_devices may modify the input_received to mitigate or avoid_interference.
