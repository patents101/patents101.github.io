In some implementations  a digital_work_provider provides a digital_work and supplemental_information_related to the digital_work for delivery to an electronic_device. For example  the digital_work_provider may parse a digital_work to identify_objects in the digital_work. The digital_work_provider may generate_supplemental_information for the digital_work_based on the objects. For example  the supplemental_information may include an index_identifying_locations of occurrences of the objects_identified in the digital_work. The supplemental_information may further include prestored_content_related to one or more of the objects. For instance  the digital_work_provider may obtain the prestored_content from one or more authoritative_network_resources. The electronic_device may display the supplemental_information in response to a user_selection of an object in the digital_work during display of the digital_work.
