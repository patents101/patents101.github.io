The present_invention_relates to touch_detection_technology and provides a capacitive_touch_sensor which comprises a driving_electrode_layer and a sensing_electrode_layer. An insulating_isolation_layer is disposed between the sensing_electrode_layer and the driving_electrode_layer. A touch_panel is disposed over the sensing_electrode_layer  and the sensing_electrode_layer has hollowed-out sensing_electrodes. The present_invention provides a new sensor_structure in which the sensing_electrode_layer  such diamond__rectangular__round etc.  is hollowed-out to improve_sensitivity of touch_detection and the signal to noise ratio  SNR .
