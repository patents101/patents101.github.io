There is provided an information_processing_apparatus_including a contact_detection_unit_capable of detecting a plurality of contact_coordinates on an operation_surface  and outputting a contact_detection_signal as a detection_result  a load_detection_unit for detecting a load_applied to the operation_surface  and a coordinate_estimation_unit  wherein when a load_detection_result_provided by the load_detection_unit_satisfies a pressed_coordinate_retrieval_condition  the coordinate_estimation_unit_estimates a pressed_coordinate from among the plurality of contact_coordinates on the operation_surface  on the basis of at least the contact_detection_signal.
