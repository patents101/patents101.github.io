Method and apparatus for provisioning an e-mail_service to a mobile_terminal in an e-mail_system that uses e-mail_addresses_comprising a domain_part. The apparatus_maintains a list of good_setting_parameter_sets_versus_e-mail_domain_parts. It receives an e-mail_address and user_authentication_information from a user and compares the domain_part of the received_address with domain_parts in the list of good_parameter_sets. If a match is found__e-mail_service is provisioned with the matching_parameter_set. If no match is found  the apparatus_requests and receives further parameters from the user__including an e-mail_server_address  and provisions the e-mail_service with the further parameters. If the provisioning with the further parameters is successful  the domain_part and the further parameters are used to generate a new setting_parameter_set in the list of good_setting_parameter_sets.
