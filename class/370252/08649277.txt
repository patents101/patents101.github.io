A packetizer_sectionalizes_data to be transmitted into predetermined_units and packetizes them into packets. A permuter_permutes the order of the packets_created by the packetizer_based on a designated_interleave_length and sends out the packets to a network. A continuous_loss_information_collector_collects_information on continuous_packet_loss_occurring on the network. An interleave_length_determiner_determines an interleave_length_based on the information on continuous_packet_loss__collected by the continuous_loss_information_collector and designates the interleave_length for the permuter.
