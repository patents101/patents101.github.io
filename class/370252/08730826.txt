Methods and apparatus for testing a network that reassembles_fragments into datagrams. A packet_receiver may extract a plurality of instrumentation_blocks from a packet_received from the network. The packet_receiver may determine if the received_packet_constitutes a correctly_reassembled_datagram_based on information_contained within the plurality of instrumentation_blocks. The packet_receiver may accumulate and report_test_statistics_indicative of a number of correctly_reassembled_datagrams_received and a number of incorrectly_reassembled_datagrams_received.
