A method for sharing a network_connection between a host_system and a virtual_machine includes receiving an incoming_data_frame. The host_system is enabled to use the network_connection using a first layer_2_address and a first layer_3_address. The first layer_2 and the first layer_3_addresses are associated with the network_connection. The virtual_machine is enabled to attempt to use the network_connection using a second layer_2_address and a second layer_3_address. The first layer_3 and the second layer_3_addresses are compliant with IPv6.
