The exemplary_embodiments of the present_invention_relate to a user_equipment and to a method for channel_estimation in a wireless_communications_network_system. The method_comprises__receiving_physical_resource_blocks from a radio_base_station__estimating a channel_coefficient of each received_physical_resource_block__calculating for each two adjacent_physical_resource_blocks  a difference between estimated_channel_coefficients of the two adjacent_physical_resource_blocks__comparing each difference with a predefined_threshold value  grouping_physical_resource_blocks for which said difference is less than or equal to the predefined_threshold value  and performing a group-wise_channel_estimation and per physical_resource_block_channel_adaptively.
