What is provided is a system for maintaining_acceptable_error_rates in a MUD-enabled ad-hoc network. In this system the power_spread associated with all of the nodes is maintained within the dynamic_range of the system  for instance 30 dB. Also  the signal-to-noise_ratio at an intended_receiver is maintained above a predetermined minimum SNR  for instance above 5 dB. If the dynamic_range_rule is not met  then the power at the transmitting_node is attenuated such that the dynamic_range_rule is met__checking to see that the minimum SNR rule is also met  or the transmission from this node is pulled. If there is no power_control_solution  then power_aware_scheduling is applied. Alternatively  only power_aware_scheduling is utilized.
