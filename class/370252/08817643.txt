In a method for monitoring a radio_link in a wireless_communication_system  a plurality of short_term_radio_link_quality_values_based on one or more measured_channel_matrices is determined. A long_term_radio_link_quality value is determined from the plurality of the short_term_radio_link_quality_values. Additionally  radio_link failure or recovery is indicated  when appropriate  based on the long_term_radio_link_quality value.
