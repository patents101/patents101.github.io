A communication_apparatus with transmitted_rate_detecting_function and the method therefore is provided. The communication_apparatus_receives an input_signal_transmitted at a first rate or a second rate from a remote_apparatus. The method includes setting the communication_apparatus to operate at an initial_receiving_rate__sampling the input_signal by a specific_sampling_frequency to generate a sample_result__estimating the input_transmitted_rate of the input_signal according to the sample_result so as to set the receiving_rate of the communication_apparatus at a working_rate  and communicating with the remote_apparatus at the working_rate. The second rate is higher than the first rate  and the specific_sampling_frequency is associated with the initial_receiving_rate.
