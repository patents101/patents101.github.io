In one embodiment  an expected transmission count  ETX  link metric is computed for a link between a transmitter and a receiver in a communication_network  the ETX representative of an expected_number of transmissions necessary for a message to be successfully_received by the receiver over the link  and a data_rate of the link at which the ETX is computed is also determined. From these  an estimated transmission overhead  ETO  link metric for the link may be computed by dividing the ETX by the data_rate. In one embodiment  the data_rate of the link may be adjusted_based on the ETO  e.g.  to minimize the ETO . In another embodiment__routes through the communication_network may be selected_based on ETO values along the route.
