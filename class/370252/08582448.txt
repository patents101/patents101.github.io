A method for managing the power_consumption of an information_handling_system_including a multi-lane_serial_link having a lane_setting that identifies the number of active_lanes in the multi-lane_serial_link. The method may include determining a number of lanes_required for the multi-lane_serial_link_based on one or more I/O devices_connected to the information_handling_system__triggering a reduction of the lane_setting of the multi-lane_serial_link if the lane_setting of the multi-lane_serial_link is greater than the determined_number of lanes_required  and automatically_reducing_power to the multi-lane_serial_link in response to the reduction of the lane_setting.
