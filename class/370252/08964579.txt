The present_invention_relates to a wireless_communication_system  and more particularly  to an apparatus for positioning a user_equipment and method_thereof. The present_invention includes receiving  from a plurality of base_stations_including a serving_cell  a predetermined_number of consecutive_positioning_subframes in a radio_frame at a predetermined_period  each of the consecutive_positioning_subframe_including a reference_signal__measuring a time of arrival of the positioning_subframes by using the reference_signal  and transmitting a result of the measured_time of arrival of the positioning_subframe to the serving_cell  wherein the predetermined_period is set to be larger than a generation_period of the reference_signal and wherein sequences of the reference_signals_included in the consecutive_positioning_subframes are different from each other.
