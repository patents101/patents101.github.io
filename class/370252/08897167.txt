Methods  systems  and computer-readable_media are provided for monitoring_circuit_diversity within a communications_network. Information is gathered regarding circuits within the communications_network. Diversity rules for the circuits are received. The diversity_rules may limit the sharing of network_resource between primary and secondary_circuit_pairs. The information regarding the circuits is analyzed to identify_violations of the diversity_rules. A report on the violations of the diversity_rules is generated.
