A method and system is disclosed for forward-link_data-rate_request_determination_based on neighbor_load. An access_terminal in a wireless_communication_system that includes a plurality of base_stations will determine an initial_requested_forward-link_data_rate by measuring a signal-to-noise ratio  SNR  of the forward_link from its serving_base_station. The access_terminal will then use information_indicative of forward-link_traffic_load of its neighboring_base_stations to modify its initial_determination  whereby the access_terminal will increase its initial_determination if the average_forward-link_traffic_load of its neighboring_base_stations is below a threshold_load. The access_terminal will then transit its forward-link_data-rate_request__initial or increased  to its serving_base_station.
