A monitoring_network is formed by a terrestrial_network and a satellite_network. The terrestrial_network has a plurality of sensor_nodes which send a data_packets. The data_packets are forwarded through sink_nodes toward a satellite and a monitoring_station in the satellite_network. The monitoring_station_performs a dynamic_selection_process for dynamically_associating each sensor_node to at least one selected_sink_node among the plurality of sink_nodes  thereby the data_packets sent by the sensor_nodes are transmitted to the satellite through only the selected_sink_node.
