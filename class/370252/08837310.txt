The invention provides a method and a system for determining an end_time of uplink_back_propagation in a mobile_communication_system to solve a problem of accurately_judging the end_time of uplink_back_propagation  wherein the method includes the following steps__sending_data with consecutive_sequence_numbers in a buffer of a packet data convergence protocol  PDCP  module to a serving gateway  S-GW  via an S1 tunnel  sending data with inconsecutive_sequence_numbers  which is from data with a first inconsecutive_sequence_number to last data in the buffer of the PDCP module  to a target_base_station via an uplink_back_propagation_tunnel__generating an end_marker_datagram__sending the end_marker_datagram to the target_base_station via the uplink_back_propagation_tunnel  and receiving  by the target_base_station  the end_marker_datagram and determining that the uplink_back_propagation has ended.
