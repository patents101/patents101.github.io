A method for device_identification includes determining a mass_event has occurred in a wireless_network from a reception of a plurality of signals each having a last gasp_message__sampling a plurality of mapped_zones associated with a base_station__identifying which mapped_zones are associated with a disconnected_endpoint in a zone_list__determining a length of time of the mass_event  and selectively providing the zone_list to identify_disconnected_endpoints_based at least upon the length of time of the mass_event. Each mapped_zone includes a plurality of wireless_device_endpoints associated with the mapped_zone. The sampling includes determining whether any of a subset of the endpoints associated with the given mapped_zone are disconnected from the wireless_network.
