A simple-structure_communication_checker_capable of detecting the communication_state of devices_communicating in different communication_methods is provided. The communication_checker includes an SLPR communication detector that detects the communication_state through the SLPR service and a FOMA communication detector that detects the communication_state through the FOMA service.
