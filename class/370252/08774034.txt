A frequency_offset_estimation and correction_method in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  OFDM  system is disclosed in present_invention__including__obtaining a pilot_frequency_domain_channel_estimation value of a target_user  and smoothing the channel_estimation value in frequency_domain__obtaining the link_quality_state of a receiver__adopting a history_smoothing_algorithm or a multi-branch_attempt_algorithm to perform_frequency_offset_estimation and frequency_offset_compensation__performing_frequency_domain_demodulation for the data for which frequency_offset_compensation has been performed  and outputting a link_quality_state_parameter  and updating the link_quality_state of the receiver according to the link_quality_state_parameter__determining the output value of this frequency_offset_estimation and outputting a history_frequency_offset value required by next frequency_offset_estimation according to the determined_output value of this frequency_offset_estimation. A corresponding apparatus is also disclosed in the present_invention.
