A method and apparatus for a cellular_system is provided. Communication is carried out between a controlling_station of a cell and a number of users in said cell  and the controlling_station is equipped with a plurality of antennas. The communication can alter between a first and a second mode  and the users in the cell_provide the controlling_station with feedback_information regarding their reception_quality. The controlling_station_alters between said first and second modes of communication as a result of the reliability of the feedback_information from the users in the cell  so that if the reliability is above a first threshold  the first mode is used  and if the reliability is equal to or below said first threshold  the second mode is used.
