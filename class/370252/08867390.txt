A close-loop_quality of service_system is provided that collects_real-time_network_performance_indicators at the physical__data_link and network_layers. Using those indicators  the system_dynamically_controls the network_traffic in order to achieve_improved_performance according to the priority and policy_defined by a data_user or system/network_administrator. Several features of this quality of service_system includes  1__dynamic_maximum_bandwidth_reallocation___2__dynamic_maximum_packet_sizing___3__adaptive_policing  and/or  4__real-time_link_status_feedbacks to make more efficient use of available bandwidth and adjust to transmission_requirements.
