Aspects of a method and system for network_communications_utilizing_shared_scalable_resources are provided. In this regard__networking_state_information for one or more of a plurality of communication_devices may be communicated to a network_management_device. The network_management_device may be operable to aggregate the networking_state_information. The plurality of communication_devices may receive_aggregated_networking_state_information from the network_management_device. The plurality of communication_devices may route_packets_based on the received_aggregated_networking_state_information. The network_management_device may be dynamically or manually_selected from the plurality of communication_devices. The plurality of communication_devices may be associated with a sharing_domain  and one or more communication_devices may be dynamically_added to and/or removed from the sharing_domain.
