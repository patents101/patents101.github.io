A method_implemented by a network_topology_design_system  the network_topology_design_system_including a processing_device. The method to determine_placement of a controller within a network with a split_architecture where control_plane_components of the split_architecture_network are executed by a controller and the control_plane_components are separate from data_plane_components of the split_architecture_network. The placement of the controller is selected to minimize_disruption of the split_architecture_network_caused by a link_failure  a switch_failure or a connectivity_loss between the controller and the data_plane_components.
