The invention provides a self-adaptive_downlink_power_control_scheme for OFDMA-based wireless cellular networks suitable for noise-limited_environments. Downlink power_levels are assigned in a distributed_manner in the absence of any requirement for coordination or cooperation between cells. Distributed assignment allows for more optimal_usage of the available transmit_power at the base_stations and more complete_exploitation of the flexibility of frequency_domain_scheduling. In one embodiment__base_stations in a cellular_network_service_mobile_user_equipment within the respective_base_station_coverage_areas  and categorize the user_equipment in a plurality of power_levels according to certain criteria in accordance with such factors as channel_experience and quality. A load-balancing_self-adjustment_mechanism allows automatic_balancing of the load between different power_levels.
