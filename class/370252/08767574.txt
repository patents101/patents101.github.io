The present_invention_relates to a method and apparatus for estimating a received_signal_power of a first transmission_channel at a receiving_node in a communications_system wherein a received_signal_comprises_information_transmitted by a transmitting_node over at least two transmission_channels. The received_signal_power of a second of the at least two transmission_channels is measured  and together with an estimate of the relationship between the transmission_power of the second transmission_channel and the transmission_power of the first transmission_channel  the measurement of the received_signal_power is used in estimating the received_signal_power of the first transmission_channel.
