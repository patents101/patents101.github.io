A system for determining_path_stability using source_routed_packets in a wireless_network_comprises a processor and a memory. The processor is configured to select a source_route on which to send one or more probing_packets  wherein the source_route includes a path between a first node and a second node and calculate a stability of the path_based at least in part on a success or a failure_location of each of the one or more probing_packets. The memory is coupled to the processor and configured to provide_instructions to the processor.
