In a wireless_communication_system__interference on data_tones is estimated by detecting_data_transmissions from interferers. An overall interference_covariance_matrix is estimated as a function of scalar_traffic to pilot ratio  TPR  estimates  residual interference covariance estimates  and covariance of channel_estimates of dominant_interferers. The interference_estimates are refined as a function of reliability_based on a ratio of power_received from a serving_cell and power_received from a dominant_interferer.
