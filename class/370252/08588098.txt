The present_invention_relates to a transmission_apparatus  a reception_apparatus  a communication_system  and a processing_method used in the reception_apparatus that are capable of reducing_collisions of an Ack frame. A transmission_apparatus__100__transmits an Ack frame  200  made up of only a PLCP preamble. In a reception_apparatus  300   an RF unit  320  supplies the Ack frame  200  received by an antenna__310  to a PMD unit  340 . The PMD unit  340  determines a termination_end of the Ack frame  200  on the basis of a signal_strength of the Ack frame  200  supplied from the RF unit  320 . Furthermore  the PMD unit  340  generates a timing of the termination_end of the PLCP preamble of the Ack frame  200  on the basis of the PLCP preamble. A PLCP unit  350  detects the Ack frame  200  on the basis of a result in which the termination_end of the Ack frame  200  has been determined using the signal_strength and the timing of the termination_end of the PLCP preamble generated by the PLCP preamble of the Ack frame  200.
