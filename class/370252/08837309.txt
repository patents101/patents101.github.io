An audio and/or visual_transmission_quality_device_estimates_transmission_quality as perceived by a user_based on observation and processing of objective_metrics. The device_preferably includes a primary_integrator to generate an instantaneous_estimate of user_annoyance_based on occurrence of frame_loss_events in a received_signal. The device further preferably includes secondary_integrators to process the instantaneous_estimate of user_annoyance in selected_time_intervals and generate a plurality of time-varying_estimates of user_annoyance_valid over the selected_time_intervals. The device may further include a plurality of scaling_modules to scale the plurality of time-varying_estimates and generate a corresponding plurality of estimates of transmission_quality as perceived by the user. The device may further include a modulation_network to modify a sensitivity of the primary_integrator to the occurrence of frame_loss_events in the received_signal.
