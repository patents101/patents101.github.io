A single_burst_method is used to determine the available bandwidth in a network_environment. A sending_node_transmits_test_packets to a receiving_node. The size of the test_packets is dynamically_determining_based on network_parameters within the network_environment. The sending_node then receives_test_receipt_packets that have the same sequence_numbers as the corresponding test_packets. Packet clusters are formed from the test_receipt_packets. The available bandwidth is determined_based on the packet_clusters along with values_set by the single_burst_method or inputted by a user.
