A method for designating a dual_region according to one embodiment of the present_invention_comprises the steps of  enabling a terminal which is in communication with a first network to calculate a channel_state_threshold value corresponding to data__comparing the channel_state value of the first network and the channel_state value of the second network__acquired using a pilot_signal of a second network  with the channel_state_threshold value  calculating a network_evaluation_score of the first network__comparing the network_evaluation_score of the first network with a network_evaluation_threshold value for designating a dual_region  if the channel_state value of the first network and the channel_state value of the second network are larger than the channel_state_threshold value  and determining whether to designate a dual_region in accordance with the result of the comparison using the network_evaluation_threshold value. The method of the present_invention can reduce_service_cutoff or delay_time during inter-radio_access.
