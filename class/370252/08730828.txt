An approach is provided for cooperatively_sharing_spectrum. A threshold value associated with an acceptable_level of interference to a first radio_network is determined. A beacon_message specifying the threshold value is generated for transmission from the first radio_network to one or more nodes of a second radio_network that is configured to exchange_traffic for mobile_services. The first radio_network and the second radio_network_share_spectral_resources_including_adjacent_bands for the respective_radio_networks  and the beacon_message is used for controlling the level of interference to the first radio_network_caused by the one or more nodes of the second radio_network.
