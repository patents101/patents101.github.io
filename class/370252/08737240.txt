A link_band_estimating_apparatus includes a packet_transmitting_unit for transmitting_packets in succession via a route_portion of communication_routes which share a link to be measured. The apparatus includes a packet_interval_measuring_unit for measuring an interval by which the packets are spaced apart in another route_portion of the communication_routes. The apparatus includes a band_calculating_unit for calculating the band of the link to be measured_based on a value measured by the packet_interval_measuring_unit and a data_size of the packets.
