Provided is a method__computer_program_product  and apparatus for estimating the quality of a call in which a first user_terminal will comprise an end_point. The method_comprises_establishing an end-to-end_connection between a first user_terminal and a node  which end-to-end_connection is via an access_point of a network by which the first user_terminal is connected to the network__displaying_information_indicative of an expected_quality of a call in which the first user_terminal will comprise an end_point  in dependence on information_indicative of the quality of the end-to-end_connection  and providing call_initiation_means for enabling a user to then selectively_establish a call between the first user_terminal and a callee. Also provided is a method__computer_program_product  and apparatus for estimating the quality of a call between a first user_terminal and a potential_callee.
