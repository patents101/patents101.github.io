A wireless_network  e.g.  an LTE network  may be configured to monitor a communications_interface to set an inactivity_timer that  in turn__sets the operating_mode of a communications_interface. The operating_mode may include a time-domain_reception_pattern of the wireless_device. A wireless_device may monitor a communications_interface that includes at least a first logical_channel and a second logical_channel. Based on monitoring the communications_interface  a first activity_state for the first logical_channel may be determined and a second activity_state  e.g.  an activity_status  for the second logical_channel may be determined. An inactivity_timer used by the communications_interface may be set to a first value or a second value based on the first and second activity_states. The battery_life of a wireless_device may be preserved by setting an inactivity_timer_responsive to how the wireless_device is used.
