Remote field testing of mobile_communication_devices is provided herein. By way of example  an IP gateway of a target_mobile_network can be monitored. A mobile_originated_data_packet associated with a test_device can be updated or translated to include information of a device that is activated on the mobile_network. Likewise  a mobile_network_originated_data_packet__routed to the activated_device and/or identifying the test_device  can be forwarded to the test_device. As described herein  two way data_exchange between the mobile_network and the test_device can be implemented even if the test_device is not pre-activated on the mobile_network. Further  an interface for the two way communication can comprise any suitable Internet Protocol  IP  network  enabling application testing remote from wireless_access_points of the mobile_network.
