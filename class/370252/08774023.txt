A system and method are provided for identifying a change_point in a set of data. The system_performs the method by receiving a set of data. The data indicates a plurality of performance_measurements from a measurement_point in a network. Each of the plurality of measurements_represents a single_type of performance_measurement_made at the measurement_point at each of a corresponding plurality of points in time. The method also includes dividing the set of data into a plurality of data_points in a chronological_order. Each data_point has a value corresponding to the performance_measurements. The method also includes ranking the data_points in an ascending_order__calculating a cumulative_sum for each of the data_points__calculating a change_score for the set of data_points. A change_point is identified in the data_set if the change_score_exceeds a predetermined_confidence_level.
