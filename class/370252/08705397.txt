A method of transmitting_signals from a transmitter of a wireless_communication_system_comprises_determining each transmission_power of a first signal and a second signal  if the difference Y in transmission_power between the first signal and the second signal_exceeds a predetermined value X  adjusting at least one of the transmission_powers of the first signal or the second signal so as not to allow the difference in adjusted_transmission_power to exceed the predetermined value  and simultaneously_transmitting the first signal and the second signal to a receiver using the adjusted_transmission_power.
