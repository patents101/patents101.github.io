A computer-implemented_method for aggregating_data for at least one resource in a target_group of resources is described. At least one resource in a target_group of resources is monitored. Data from the at least one resource are collected in accordance with a single_metric. The data_collected from the at least one resource are aggregated. A predefined_operation is executed on the aggregated_data. A single_instance of data_representative of the aggregated_data_collected from the at least one resource in the target_group of resources is generated.
