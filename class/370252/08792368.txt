The method of computing the available space in a packet for data_stream_transport_comprises                     a step of determining the requirements of each module of a data_stream_manager  for space in the packet for at least two types of header and/or extension_data_required by each protocol and/or service used by said module           a step of determining a maximum_space_requirement in the packet to meet all these requirements  by implementing different rules for combining_space_requirements for the different types of data and a sum of the combined_requirements for the different types of data and          a step of computing a difference between the space of the packet and the maximum_space_requirement in the packet in order to determine the available space for data_stream_transport.
