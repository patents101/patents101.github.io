A beacon_signal_including_image_information and an application to cause acknowledgment of receipt of the beacon_signal is transmitted in order to measure_approximate_latency in transmission over a communication_link that exhibits_latency such as a packet_switched_digital_network. Transmission latency for image_information for an image_included in a web_conference is then estimated and elapsed_time after transmission of such image_information is measured and an indication_provided to a presenter or conference_monitor when the image should be visible to a conference_participant which can be easily_selected by the presenter.
