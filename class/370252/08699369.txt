The present_disclosure provides a system and a method for providing mobility_management and out-of-coverage_indication in a hybrid_system_comprised of conventional LMR sites and trunking LMR sites. If a radio is located at a conventional_site  the radio provides its location and user_group_data to the disclosed_system through its traffic_channel when the channel is idle. If the radio is located at a trunking_site  the radio provides its location and user_group_data to the disclosed_system through the trunking_site s control_channel. Knowledge of the radio s current_location and user_group_data is used to provide_dynamic_call_routing and data_management within the disclosed_system. The disclosed_system and method provides seamless_communication between a trunking_site and a conventional_site while concurrently_enhancing the hybrid_system to provide_mobility_management and out-of-coverage_indication_features_typically associated with a stand-alone trunking_system.
