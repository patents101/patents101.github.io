A test_device includes a virtual_machine. The device has a virtual_bridge which  when receiving a packet_transmitted from the virtual_machine to a computer_connected via a network__transmits the packet to the computer via a physical_interface of the test_device. The device has a load_generating_unit for generating a first packet that provides a communication_load and transmitting the generated first packet to the virtual_bridge. The device has a return_unit for receiving the generated first packet from the virtual_bridge  not transmitting the generated first packet to the computer__returning the first packet to the second virtual_machine by changing a destination_address  and terminating the transmission.
