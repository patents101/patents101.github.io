Systems and methodologies are described that determine whether to communicate an update_message to a UICC. A UE may be equipped a status_update_message from at least one of a first radio access technology  RAT  module supporting a first RAT and a second RAT module supporting a second RAT. The first RAT and the second RAT are different. Further  the UE may be equipped to determine whether to generate a universal integrated circuit card  UICC  update_message to update a UICC by applying one or more RAT arbitration factors to the received_status_update_message. The UICC includes current UICC status information associated with a current RAT. A status_update_message may include  a service status  RAT information  and location_information  and the UE may apply the RAT arbitration factors to at least a portion of the status_update_message.
