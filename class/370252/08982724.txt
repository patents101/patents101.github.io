A system and method are provided for implementing a peak-to-average power ratio  PAPR  reduction scheme for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access  OFDMA  modulation. A unique PAPR reduction scheme for OFDMA modulation for systems_operated according to a DOCSIS standard achieves results similar to those attributable to tone_reservation_schemes in a manner that does not negatively_affect an amount of available data_capacity  particularly in implementations with limited_numbers of subcarriers. The disclosed_systems and methods are particularly adaptable to next generation_cable_gateways and/or next generation_cable_modems. These next generation_cable_gateways and/or cable_modems may find particular utility in advanced_hybrid_fiber/coaxial_cable_systems. The adaptable_cable_gateways/modems may include a cable gateway system-on-chip  SOC  configuration. The disclosed_schemes may be applicable to OFDM modulation. For OFDM  however  the known tone_reservation_algorithms also may be employed.
