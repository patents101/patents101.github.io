In one embodiment  the method of configuring a common search space  CSS  for at least one user equipment  UE  in a wireless_communication_system with at least a first type of physical_downlink_control_channel includes broadcasting at least one parameter of a common search space  CSS  none of the parameters being the number of orthogonal frequency-division multiplex  OFDM  symbols. In one embodiment  a method of configuring a default user equipment-specific search space  USS  for a user equipment  UE  in a wireless_communication_system with at least a first type of physical_downlink_control_channel includes broadcasting at least one parameter of the default USS  none of the parameters being based on an identifier of the UE. The broadcasting may occur before UE-specific signaling. In one embodiment  a method of configuring or reconfiguring the USS may include transmitting at least one parameter of the USS with UE-specific signaling.
