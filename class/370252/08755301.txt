The present_invention provides a system and method of modifying_policy_settings in a network having a plurality of subscriber_devices. An embodiment includes a plurality of base_stations  each capable of wirelessly_transmitting across a geographic_region. A cell-phone__capable of roaming between regions is operable to establish a wireless_link with the base_stations. The network contains a communication_policy_determining from which other communication_devices a subscriber_device can receive_voice_calls. A copy of this policy is stored on each subscriber_device as a database and periodically_updated as the devices_make_contact with the base_stations or other subscriber_devices. When receiving a voice_call  the device first determines who the originator of the call is and then determines whether it is allowed to receive the call from that originator according to its policy_database. The policy_database can be updated either by subscriber_devices or by base_stations.
