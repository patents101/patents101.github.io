A method_processes_data in a packet-switched_communication_network having a plurality of network_nodes  between which data_packets are transmitted. Information contained in one data_packet is extracted_therefrom  the packet being received in a network_node. One physical_transmission_parameter of the received_data_packet is ascertained  the physical_transmission_parameter_specifies or is dependent on one property of the physical_transmission of the received_data_packet. The received_data_packet is filtered_based on a rule_set__taking into account some of the extracted_information and part of the physical_transmission_parameter  and further processed_dependant on the filtering. An application of the method is    bootstrapping     wherein network_nodes are configured__cryptographic_information being transmitted in the context of the configuration. A plausibility_test of physical_transmission_parameters of the data_packets that are transmitted during bootstrapping can ascertain whether an attacker is manipulating the bootstrapping_process.
