A power-efficient_link_group-based_communication_system is provided. In link_group-based_communication  according to the amount of transmitted_traffic  an appropriate number of links in a link_group are set to active_mode to be used for traffic_transmission  and the rest of the links in the link_group are set to power_save_mode  thereby not transmitting_traffic. Thus  efficient_power_reduction in the link_group-based_communication can be realized.
