The present_invention_relates to a solution for taking into account that the interference  which each of the transmission_resource_elements is affected by  may differ between the different transmission_resource_elements when determining an interference_estimate by determining a mixed_interference_estimate  e.g. based on both reference_symbols and data_symbols. Furthermore  signalling from the network is also introduced which makes it possible to control what the mixed_interference_estimate should be based on.
