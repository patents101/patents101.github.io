Adaptive generation of channel_quality_indicators_based on a current_communication_scenario. A plurality of sets of channel_quality_indicator_information may be stored for each of a plurality of UE communication scenarios. The information may be usable in generating a channel_quality_indicator. During operation of the UE  a current_communication_scenario of the UE may be determined. A first set of channel_quality_indicator_information may be selected_based on the determined_current_communication_scenario being experienced by the UE. At least one channel_quality_indicator may be determined_based on the selected first set of channel_quality_indicator_information. Finally  the channel_quality_indicator may be provided to a base_station.
