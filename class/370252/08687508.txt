In a wireless_communication_system_including at least one wireless transmit/receive unit  WTRU  and at least one Node-B  NB  an activation or deactivation_state is determined for each of a plurality of HARQ processes. A signal that includes the activation or deactivation_state for each of the HARQ processes is transmitted to the WTRU. In response to receiving the signal  the WTRU activates or deactivates a particular HARQ process in accordance with the activation or deactivation_state for each of the HARQ processes contained in the received_signal.
