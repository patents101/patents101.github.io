The resources include a plurality of carriers that are shared with other nodes. In an approach  the node_determines a condition_related to a plurality of resources__identify a desired_amount of resources from the plurality of resources_based on the condition  and transmit a resource utilization message  RUM  for at least one of the plurality of resources_based on the desired_amount of resources.
