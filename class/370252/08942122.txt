At least one neighbor_cell is identified by a base_station by detecting a synchronization_signal of the at least one neighbor_cell. A received_signal_power  such as a Reference Signal Received Power  RSRP  or a Reference Signal Received Quality  RSRQ  or a combination_thereof  is also measured from the at least one neighbor_cell. Identifying information and the received_signal_power of the at least one neighbor_cell is then communicated to a network_entity of the wireless_network. Information is received from the network_entity_indicating whether the base_station can enable a reconfiguration of the allocation of uplink and downlink_subframes used in the cell of the base_station. Based on the information_received from the network_entity  the base_station_enables a reconfiguration of the allocation of uplink and downlink_subframes used in the cell.
