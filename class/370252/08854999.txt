Method and arrangement in a base_station for scheduling_radio_resources to a user_equipment. The method and arrangement_comprises_receiving a scheduling_request from the user_equipment  and also a time_offset value which value is associated with the moment of time when a frame of data was generated in the user_equipment_buffer. Also  the moment of time when the frame of data was generated in the user_equipment_buffer is determined__based on the received_time_offset value. Thereby the buffer_state of the user_equipment_buffer is predicted by using the determined_moment of time when the frame of data was generated in the user_equipment_buffer. Further  radio_resources are granted to the user_equipment__based on the predicted_buffer_state of the user_equipment_buffer. In addition  a method and arrangement in a user_equipment for assisting the base_station in scheduling_radio_resources are described.
