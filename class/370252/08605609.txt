A method is provided for simulation of multiple_network_nodes in an internetwork. A range of a plurality of network_addresses are assigned to a simulation_node. The simulation_node_monitors_network_communications to listen for packets. Upon receipt of a packet having a destination_address within the assigned_range  a command is forwarded to an end-use application  such as firmware. The end-use application_processes the command and returns a result. A response_packet having the result is transmitted to the back_office_server with the destination_address of the received_packet as the source of the response_packet.
