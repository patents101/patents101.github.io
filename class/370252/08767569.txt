A communications_interface between an end-user and an edge_node of a communication_network for establishing__prior to data_transmission  the differentiated_service_code_points_supported by the network. The end-user first issues a service_request_message___42   to an edge_node of the communication_network. The edge_node_responds with an acknowledgement_message___44___carrying_information as to which DSCP s the network is able to support. Finally  the application at the end-user can decide how to mark the relevant_packets during data_transmission_depending on the levels of differentiated_service_supported by the network.
