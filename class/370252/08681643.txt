A system and method of determining_data_latency in a network is provided. A first data_sample of application_level_data  e.g.  financial_data  is provided from a data_stream_received at a first network_point. A second data_sample of application_level_data  e.g.  financial_data  is also provided from a data_stream_received at a second network_point  where the data_streams in the first and second network_points include common_data and the first and second data_samples include common_data. A correlation between common_data in the first and second data_samples is determined and a time_difference between the correlated_common_data in the first and second data_samples is then calculated.
