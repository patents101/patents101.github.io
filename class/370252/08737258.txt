A multiservice_communication_device includes a plurality of transceivers that wirelessly_transceive_data with a corresponding plurality of networks in accordance with a corresponding plurality of network_protocols. An environmental_monitoring_receiver processes received RF signals over a broadband_spectrum and that generates_environmental_data in response_thereto. A processing_module_processes the environmental_data and generates a least one control_signal in response_thereto  the at least one control_signal for adapting at least one of the plurality of transceivers_based on the environmental_data. In an embodiment of the present_invention  the environmental_monitoring_receiver can be implemented via one of the plurality of transceivers when operating in an environmental_monitoring_mode.
