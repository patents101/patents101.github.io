A wireless_client_station includes a signal_strength_module_configured to estimate_signal_strengths of signals_received from a plurality of access_points  wherein each of the signals includes a transmit_power_level_signal. A control_module is configured to determine_path_losses for each of the plurality of access_points in response to the signal_strengths and the transmit_power_level_signals. The control_module is configured to associate with one of the plurality of access_points having a lowest one of the path_losses. The control_module is configured to adjust a minimum_transmit_power_level of the wireless_client_station in response to the lowest one of the path_losses and a receiver_sensitivity of the wireless_client_station.
