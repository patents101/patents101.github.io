A method for scheduling_transmissions in wireless_network includes receiving_information_ranging from conventional_data to real-time_streaming_applications into a basestation of an OFDMA wireless relay network and scheduling_transmission of the information from the basestation by influencing_adaptive_frame_segmentation and access_hop_reuse in the transmission of the information for achieving_higher_transmission_flow of the information  Where the scheduling is formulated as an integer_program  the scheduling includes solving a linear_programming_relaxation of the integer_program and rounding to integral_allocations with allocation to at least one of a subset of wireless_users and subsets of relays in the network for obtaining_frame_segmentation and reuse. Where the scheduling is formulated by following a bisection_approach to guide_adaptation of the frame_segmentation  the scheduling_determines a subset of users with maximum_flow per unit_resource for a given frame_segmentation and the resulting_flow from current and previous_scheduling being used to guide_adaptation of frame_segmentation towards convergence.
