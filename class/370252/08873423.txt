A method of controlling_connection between nodes in a digital_interface whereby a first node that is a master_node_determines a second node to be the master and controls a point-to-point_connection or a broadcast_connection to another node. The first node having the display_device_determines the second node to be the master in accordance with a user_selection  and transmits a connection_command of a predetermined_format for transmitting a data_stream to the second node. The second node_determined as the master in accordance with the transmitted_connection_command of the predetermined_format is allocated with a channel and a bandwidth from an isochronous resource manager  IRM  and performs a point-to-point_connection between the second node and the first node to transit the data_stream. Thus  the transmission/reception__reproduction  and control of the data_stream of the program can be smoothly_performed.
