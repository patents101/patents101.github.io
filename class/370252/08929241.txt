A method for transmitting_feedback_information via a Spatial Rank Index  SRI  channel includes determining  at an access_terminal  a value of a spatial_rank_index and transmitting  from the access_terminal through the SRI channel  feedback information indicating the determined value of the spatial_rank_index according to a prescribed_coding. The codeword of the prescribed_coding is one of   0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0___1_0_1_0_1_1_0_1___0_1_1_1_0_0_1_1  or  1_1_0_1_1_1_1_0 .
