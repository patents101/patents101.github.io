A method of operating a wireless_device includes communicating in one of peer-to-peer_data_resources or non peer-to-peer_resources. The peer-to-peer_data_resources include a first set of peer-to-peer_resources with a first bandwidth and a second set of peer-to-peer_resources with a second bandwidth_greater than the first bandwidth. The first set of peer-to-peer_resources is parallel in time with the non peer-to-peer_resources. In addition  the method includes estimating a signal_quality for a data_transmission on the peer-to-peer_data_resources. Furthermore  the method includes determining whether to send the data_transmission in one of the first set of peer-to-peer_resources or the second set of peer-to-peer_resources_based on the estimated_signal_quality.
