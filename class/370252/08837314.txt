A method of configuring a communication_network_including a network_device includes obtaining a first parameter associated with a predetermined_topological_characteristic of the communication_network  a second parameter associated with a communication_protocol of the communication_network and a third parameter associated with a performance_characteristic of the communication_network  and calculating a connection_timeout value based on the first parameter  the second parameter and the third parameter. The network_device is configured to determine whether a communication_timeout has occurred on the communication_network_based on the connection_timeout value. Calculating the connection_timeout value may include calculating a sum of the first parameter  the second parameter and the third parameter.
