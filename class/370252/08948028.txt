Techniques for reporting_timing_information to facilitate_data_transmission on a downlink are described. A user equipment  UE  may receive_signals from a plurality of cells available for data_transmission to the UE. Each cell may have a different propagation_delay to the UE. The UE may determine_timing_information_based on the received_signals and may report the timing_information to one or more of the cells. The timing_information may include a receive_time of each cell at the UE. The UE may receive a data_transmission from at least one cell  which can be selected from the plurality of cells__based on the timing_information. The at least one cell may provide a coordinated or a non-coordinated_data_transmission. A coordinated_transmission_mode may be determined_based on the timing_information and can include  for example  a joint_transmission  a coordinated_beamforming  or a coordinated_silencing.
