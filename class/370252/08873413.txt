A signal_measurement_method and a device for comparing_measurement_results of a serving_cell and a neighbor_cell in a wireless_communication_system are provided. The method includes receiving a resource_restriction_pattern_including first pattern_information that indicates specific_subframes to be restricted in measurement of the serving_cell__measuring the neighbor_cell at a first frequency_band__measuring  if a predetermined_condition is met  the serving_cell_applying the first pattern_information  and measuring  if the predetermined_condition is not met  the serving_cell without applying the first pattern_information and performing_evaluation by comparing a serving_cell_measurement_result_obtained from measurement of the serving_cell with a neighbor_cell_measurement_result_obtained from measurement of the neighbor_cell.
