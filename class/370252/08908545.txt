A system and method for improving TCP performance in a L2 tunneling environment by snooping TCP/IP packets from the tunnel interface  terminating TCP locally and proxying TCP data in separate TCP connections. In particular  the system and method_detects an encapsulated_outgoing_packet_utilizing a Layer 2 tunneling protocol  processes a Point to Point Protocol layer in the outgoing_packet to establishing Layer 2 tunneling protocol for a connection. The system and method also removes the Point to  Point Protocol layer from the outgoing_packet and inspects the outgoing_packet for TCP information in the packet. The system and method_forwards the outgoing_packet to a locally_driven_application_protocol_path if TCP information is present  wherein the outgoing_packet is encapsulated in association with the application_protocol_path.
