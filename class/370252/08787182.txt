Improved systems and methods for configuring_network_devices are provided. Aspects of the invention_relate to novel QoS configuration_parameters and methods for using QoS configuration_parameters to reduce_impacts_caused by security_breach within a network. In one embodiment  a QoS configuration parameter is selected from a plurality of configuration_parameters on a central_database_based upon unique_identifying_information of a network_device and a status_signal. In one embodiment  each configuration_parameter_comprises at least a first parameter for configuring a communication_speed of the network_device and a second parameter_configurable to alter the ability of the network_device to communicate with another device in the network. Further aspects of the invention_relate to providing improved_services to an end_user. In one embodiment__services may be customized to an end_user and allow increased_flexibility for both the service_provider and the end_user.
