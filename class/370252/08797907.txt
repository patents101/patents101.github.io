Feedback indicates low signal-to-noise ratio  SNR  conditions for a wireless_communications_link between a transmitter_device and a receiver_device. After attempting to achieve a target_packet_error_rate  PER  by increasing_transmission_power for the wireless_communications_link  the transmitter_device_receives_feedback that indicates a current PER  for data_transmitted using an initial automatic repeat request  ARQ  block size  is above the target PER for the receiver_device  and changes  based on the feedback  the current ARQ block size to a different ARQ block size for the wireless_communications_link. The different ARQ block size may be adaptively_selected to provide a maximum PDU size that achieves the target PER at the receiver_device under the low SNR conditions.
