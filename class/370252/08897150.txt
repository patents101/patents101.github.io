A method of discarding_logged_measurements in a wireless_communication_system is provided. A user_equipment in a Radio Resource Control  RRC  connected mode receives a Minimization of Drive Tests  MDT  configuration from a base_station and starts a validity_timer upon receiving the MDT configuration. The user_equipment in an RRC idle mode logs measurements based on the MDT configuration to collect_logged_measurements while the validity_timer is running. When the validity_timer is expired  the user_equipment_discards the MDT configuration and starts a conservation_timer. When the conservation_timer is expired  the logged_measurements are discarded.
