Systems and methods_involving_construction of a system_interconnect in which different channels have different widths in numbers of bits. Example processes to construct such a heterogeneous channel NoC interconnect are disclosed herein  wherein the channel_width may be determined_based upon the provided_specification of bandwidth and latency between various components of the system.
