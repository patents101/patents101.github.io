A first node of a radio_network_initiates a mode for finding the range to a second node. The first node_transmits to the second node  with the address of the second node  a range_finding_command  which switches the second node into the range_finding_mode and controls a sequence. The first node_transmits in a transmission_time_window a first signal  which is received by the second node in an associated reception_time_window  a first phase value of the first signal being measured. The second node_transmits in a transmission_time_window a second signal  which is received by the first node in an associated reception_time_window  a second phase value of the second signal being measured. The first frequency is changed by a frequency_difference and the second frequency is changed by the frequency_difference in a subsequent_time_window of the sequence.
