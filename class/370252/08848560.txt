A system and method for communication in a wireless_communication_network are disclosed. One embodiment of the system includes an overlay_access_node that supports Almost Blank Subframes  ABSs . The overlay_access_node  such as macro eNB  can receive_measurement_results from one or more user equipments  including macro user equipments  UEs  and/or pico  UEs  either directly or via an underlay_access_node  such as a pico eNB. The macro eNB can determine a set of macro UEs that are sufficiently_close to the macro eNB for transmission during ABSs with a low_transmission_power or beamforming without significant_interference to the pico UEs. This scheme_improves the throughput of transmission between the macro eNB and macro UEs while reducing_interference to the pico UEs.
