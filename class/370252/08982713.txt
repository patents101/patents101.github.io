Techniques to configure_quality of service  QoS  for communication are described. An access_terminal_configures a first QoS profile prior to a call. This QoS profile is for a set of QoS parameters that provides certain QoS. The access_terminal thereafter establishes  e.g.  originates or terminates  a call with an access_network. If the first QoS profile is appropriate for the call  then QoS is not reconfigured. However  the access_terminal may determine that a second QoS profile is to be used for the call  e.g.  based on a format or a rate_set_supported by a remote/other terminal for the call. The access_terminal would then configure the second QoS profile during the call. The access_terminal may exchange_data in accordance with  a  the first QoS profile before the second QoS profile is configured and activated and  b  the second QoS profile after it is configured and activated.
