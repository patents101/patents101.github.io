A method and apparatus for congestion and fault_management with time-to-live  TTL  have been disclosed. Each time a packet is transferred into an Egress Port s Final Buffer  an associated TTL Timeout Counter will be loaded with a value. If the packet cannot be transferred out of the Egress Port before TTL timeout  it will be purged by removing a memory_buffer_pointer from the corresponding Virtual Output Queue  VOQ  entry.
