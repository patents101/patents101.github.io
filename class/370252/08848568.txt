A user_device_receives_packets from a base_station. The user_device may invoke_decoding while the packet is still being received__based on the incomplete_contents of a given packet. This    partial_packet_decoding____relies on the fact that the underlying_information in the packet is encoded with redundancy__code_rate less than one . If link_quality is poor  the partial_packet_decoding is likely to be unsuccessful  i.e.  to fail in its attempt to recover the underlying_information. To avoid_waste of power  the user_device may be configured to apply one or more tests of link_quality_prior to invoking the partial_packet_decoding on a current_packet.
