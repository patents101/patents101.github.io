Operator-controlled implementations of user_preferences are provided when feasible. User preference data is obtained by the operator and compared to operational_characteristics and parameters of a communication_system  such as a DSL system  to determine whether one or more of the user_preferences can be implemented in the communication_system. When implementation of a user_preference would violate_operational_rules of the system  or where implementation would adversely_affect_system_operation  the preference need not be implemented. However  when a user_preference can be implemented in the system without causing_problems  the operator can implement  or permit another party to implement  the user_preference to effect the user s desires. The user_preference_data can be obtained_directly from users  for example  by surveys and other direct_user_feedback  or can be obtained_indirectly  for example  by constructing a Hidden Markov Model that shows_user_preferences . The operator may collect the user_preference_data from a user_set  for example  a single_user or a plurality of users . The user_preference_data can be compared to 2 or more performance_metrics that can be adjusted  to the extent_feasible  to implement the user_preference_data.
