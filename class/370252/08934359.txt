A method for managing_upstream_burst_overhead_parameters includes  an Optical Line Terminal  OLT  or an Optical Network Unit  ONU  detects transmission_quality of a downlink between the OLT and the ONU  the OLT or the ONU determines the upstream_burst_overhead_parameters_suitable for the ONU according to the transmission_quality  and the ONU starts to use the upstream_burst_overhead_parameters_suitable for the ONU after the switching_time_determined by the ONU itself or indicated by the OLT. The present_invention also provides an ONU and an OLT for managing the upstream_burst_overhead_parameters. The present_invention can improve the bandwidth_utilization_rate and decrease the complexity of indicating the upstream_burst_overhead_parameters in PON system  so that the ONU and the OLT are enabled to flexibly and simply_select the upstream_burst_overhead_parameters.
