A method__system  and computer_program_product for providing feedback over a multiple_path_network is provided. A first device_sends a transmissions to a second device over at least two different paths of the network. Using information_collected as a result of receiving the transmissions  the second device_aggregates_data regarding the performance of each of the paths together into a feedback_message. The second device then sends this feedback_message to the first device over one path of the network. The first device uses the data in the feedback_message in its calculations for determining the relative_performance of each path. The amount of traffic sent along each path is adjusted as appropriate  based on these calculations.
