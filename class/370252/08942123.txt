The deferral_mechanism described herein may improve_medium_reuse in a wireless_network with transmit_power_imbalances. For example  in one embodiment  an apparatus_employing the deferral_mechanism described herein may comprise a receiver to sense a data_unit_transmitted on a medium associated with the wireless_network  wherein the data_unit may comprise_information_indicating a transmit_power associated therewith. Furthermore  the apparatus may comprise one or more processors to initiate a transmission on the medium associated with the wireless_network if the apparatus is not an intended_receiver of the sensed_data_unit  the transmit_power associated with the data_unit_exceeds a transmit_power associated with the apparatus  and a received_power associated with the data_unit does not equal or exceed a clear_channel_assessment_threshold plus a difference between the transmit_power associated with the data_unit and the transmit_power associated with the apparatus.
