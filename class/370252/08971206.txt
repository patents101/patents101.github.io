A method of receiving a data_transmission includes detecting a first switching of a transmission_signal to a first signal value  starting a duration_measurement of a first time_interval that begins with detecting the first switching of the transmission_signal__detecting a second switching of the transmission_signal to a second signal value  stopping the measurement of the first time_interval_duration and starting a second duration_measurement of a second time_interval__detecting a third switching of the transmission_signal to the first signal value or to a third signal value  stopping the second measurement in response to detecting the third switching__determining a relation of the first and second time_interval_durations from the first and second measurements  and determining a data value of the transmission_signal_based on the determined_relation.
