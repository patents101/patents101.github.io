A user equipment UE reports its UE-specific channel quality to the network. The network uses this to narrow a search_space in which the UE looks for its downlink_control_signaling. In one embodiment the search_space is defined by downlink_signaling the network_sends. The width of the search_space may also select between types of downlink_control_signaling  for example  between PDCCH and E-PDCCH . In the specific_examples described the poorest_channel_qualities_result in the whole-bandwidth PDCCH being used while better channel_qualities_result in progressively_narrower_search_spaces to look for an E-PDCCH.
