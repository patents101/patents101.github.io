A packet-based_communications_network is dimensioned_based on a maximum_number of users able to receive a predetermined_target_throughput of data over a predetermined_number of channels. For each of an incremental_number of users  at least one blocking_probability is calculated__based on a traffic_distribution_model  and a service_delay is calculated__based on the blocking_probability. An iterative_throughput  corresponding to each of the incremental_number of users  is determined_based on the corresponding blocking_probability and service_delay. Each iterative_throughput is compared to the target_throughput. The maximum_number of users is identified as the number of users having a corresponding iterative_throughput that is closest to and less than target_throughput.
