A method for reporting uplink control information  UCI  on a user equipment  UE  is described. A number of bits for a channel_quality_indicator and/or a precoding_matrix_index and/or a rank indication  CQI/PMI/RI  is obtained. A number of component_carriers with hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement  HARQ-ACK  reporting is also obtained. A total_number of HARQ-ACK bits is further obtained. A number of HARQ-ACK bits that can be carried on the physical uplink control channel  PUCCH  is determined. Bundling is performed on the total_number of HARQ-ACK bits to be reported to fit the total_number of HARQ-ACK bits to be reported into the number of HARQ-ACK bits that can be carried on the PUCH. A backward compatible PUCCH format is used to simultaneously_carry the CQI/PMI/RI bits and the HARQ-ACK bits.
