Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate_managing_interaction between paging and discontinuous reception  DRX  cycles for users_operating in a communication_system. As described herein  a connected_mode_user having an associated DRX cycle can modify its schedule for paging_reception to minimize_unnecessary_periods of activity. For example  a user can initially_schedule_monitoring of paging_occasions that coincide with periods of activity associated with the DRX cycle of the user. If such paging_occasions are not sufficient to reach a minimum_required_number of monitored_paging_occasions__additional_paging_occasions can be monitored as needed by scheduling_additional_periods of activity and/or extending_periods of activity specified in the DRX cycle. Additionally or alternatively  a network can synchronize a connected mode DRX cycle associated with a user with an idle_mode_paging_cycle for the user  thereby providing power and performance_benefits with low_complexity.
