A network based positioning  NBP  system that improves the accuracy of wireless_positioning_systems by concurrently performing RTT ranging operations and associated TDOA operations to generate a number of difference_measurement_values from which the position of a station device  STA  can be determined using  for example  multilateration_techniques. Because the RTT values and their corresponding TDOA values both include the turn-around time  TAT  of the STA  subtracting TDOA values from their corresponding RTT values generates difference_measurement_values that do not include such TAT values of the STA. In this manner  the STA position can be determined without estimating the STA s TAT.
