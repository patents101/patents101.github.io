An analysis of a communication_configuration in a process control  PC  or substation automation  SA  system is disclosed  wherein network_messages  and/or respective_message_sources__configured for transmission across a communication_network of the system can be evaluated. From a logical_data_flow_description that is part of a standardized_configuration_representation of the PC or SA system and which includes  in the form of control_blocks__formal_information for every message  receiver intelligent electronic devices  IEDs  can be retrieved or determined. For each retrieved receiver IED  the totality of all network_messages_destined for or directed to this particular receiver IED can be evaluated or processed  e.g. in view of a subsequent_network_load_analysis__virtual_local_area_network_assignment  or graphical_display of the data_flow . Exemplary network_messages of interest include cyclic_point-to-point_reports__periodic or repeated real-time multicast messages  Sampled Values SV  and event-based multicast messages  generic object oriented substation events GOOSE .
