In order to determine whether a hybrid automatic repeat request  HARQ  indicator received by user equipment  UE  from a base_station is an acknowledgment  ACK  or negative acknowledgement  NACK  when a signal_representing the HARQ indicator is received by the UE  a plurality of symbols_encoded in the received_signal are determined to obtain a softbit for each of the symbols by summing an in-phase_component and a quadrature_component of each symbol. Thereafter  the softbits are summed up to be compared with the amplitude of the symbols to determine whether the HARQ indicator is an ACK or NACK.
