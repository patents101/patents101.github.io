In one embodiment  a device in a computer_network_receives a particular packet associated with a transmission_attempts value  the associated transmission_attempts value indicative of a first number of times a transmitter has attempted to transmit the particular packet. In response  the device_increases by one a stored_successful_attempts value stored at the device  the stored_successful_attempts value indicative of a second number of times the device has received the same particular packet. As such  a reachability_rate of a link from the transmitter to the device may be determined_based on comparing the associated transmission_attempts value to the stored_successful_attempts value.
