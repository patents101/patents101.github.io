A method and apparatus_estimate a delay of buffer_data of a User Equipment  UE  in a mobile_communication_system. A message_comprising the size of buffer_data is received from a UE. The size of the buffer_data of the UE is distributed into a plurality of groups_based on a time_point of receiving the message_comprising the size of the buffer_data of the UE. A delay for each of the plurality of groups is estimated using a time_interval of execution of delay_estimation for the buffer_data of the UE.
