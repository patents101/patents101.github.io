Provide are a method  a system and an apparatus for transmitting_channel_quality_indicator_information of multiple_user_terminals. The method includes  at least two user_terminals_transmit their own channel_quality_indicator_information using the same time and frequency_resources  wherein the time and frequency_resources include at least one frequency-domain_unit in frequency_domain and at least two sets of data_time-domain_units in time_domain  each set of data_time-domain_units_including at least two data_time-domain_units  and the channel_quality_indicator_information of each user_terminal is transmitted on at least one set of data_time-domain_units by means of time-domain Code Division Multiple Address. Therefore  it is possible to adjust the transmitted_bits according to size of the channel_quality_indicator_information.
