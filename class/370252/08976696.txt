Methods and systems for simultaneous_determination of channel_resource_allocations and beam_vectors for uplink_frames are disclosed. One method includes receiving_batch_information from client_devices_indicating_amounts of data to be transmitted on the uplink by the client_devices. Further  signal_quality can be measured on channel_resources for each of the client_devices and for each of a plurality of beam_vectors. Additionally  rate information for the channel_resources for each of the client_devices is determined_based on signal_quality_measurements. Moreover  the method includes computing__based on the batch_information and the rate_information__utilities for allocations of the channel_resources to the client_devices and for the beam_vectors for at least one uplink_frame and selecting__based on the utilities  at least one of the beam_vectors and at least one of the allocations for transmission of the data on the uplink_frame s .
