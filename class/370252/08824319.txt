In a vehicle-side_transmitting_apparatus that applies a multi-link_system_employing a logical_plurality of communication_lines and includes a transmitting_unit that transmits_transmission_data that should be transmitted to a receiving_apparatus of a communication_partner  the transmitting_unit_monitors changes in transmission_rates of communication_lines A to C  calculates__based on rated_transmission_rates__information concerning changes in the communication_lines A to C  and a transmission_time until data that should be transmitted to a ground-side_receiving_apparatus is completed to be transmitted to the ground-side_receiving_apparatus__fluctuating_transmission_rates of the communication_lines A to C  and determines__based on the calculated_transmission_rates__allocation_amounts to the communication_lines of data that should be transmitted this time.
