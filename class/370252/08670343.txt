A system and method for configuring a variable Channel Quality Information  CQI  reporting period based on a User Equipment s  UE  Doppler frequency or speed. Mobile users are divided into three Doppler frequency regions based on their speed   for example  low__medium  and high Doppler users   and are assigned the CQI reporting periods accordingly by the base_station. The users in the low and high Doppler regions  i.e.  UEs with low and high_speeds__receive a high value for the CQI reporting period  whereas   the users in the medium Doppler region  i.e.  UEs with medium_speeds__receive a low value for the CQI reporting period. The UE speed-specific CQI reporting period improves the uplink_capacity by adaptively_controlling a UE s CQI-related uplink transmissions  without compromising on the downlink_capacity/throughput.
