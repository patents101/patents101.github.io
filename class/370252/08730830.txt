Provided is an indoor_location_measuring_method and apparatus. The indoor_location_measuring_apparatus that measures a location of a communication_terminal within a building by determining a floor where the communication_terminal is located may include a floor_classifying_means for classifying_information_relating to a plurality of access points  APs  and collected by the communication_terminal for each floor  and a location_determining_means for assigning a grade_constant to each item of AP information classified for each floor_based on the signal_intensity_included in the AP information  and for calculating the sum of the grade_constants for each floor  and for determining a floor having the largest_sum as a location of the communication_terminal.
