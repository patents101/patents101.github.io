Systems and methods of Voice over Internet Protocol  VoIP  communication are provided. A particular system includes a VoIP endpoint. The VoIP endpoint is adapted to monitor a packet_loss_measure between the VoIP endpoint and a second VoIP endpoint during a VoIP communication using a first CODEC. The VoIP endpoint is also adapted to negotiate with the second VoIP endpoint to select a substitute CODEC having a nominal_data_rate that is lower than an in-use nominal_data_rate of the first CODEC.
