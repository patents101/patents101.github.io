The present_invention provides a method for mitigating_outages in wireless_communication_systems using feedback for control_channels_formed by aggregating_groups of resource_blocks or resource_elements  the method. One embodiment of the method includes generating_control_channel_feedback at user_equipment. The control_channel_feedback is generated using one or more measurements_performed on signals_received at the user_equipment over a downlink_control_channel at a current_aggregation_level. The method also includes transmitting the control_channel_feedback over an uplink_channel and using this information for the optimal_implementation of Cell range expansion by the network.
